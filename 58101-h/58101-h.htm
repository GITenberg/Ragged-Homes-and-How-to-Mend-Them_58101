<p>I do not inscribe this narrative of facts to you in the
expectation of adding to that acquaintance with the
working-classes which you have gained from personal intercourse
with them.</p>
<p>It is for my own satisfaction that I have dedicated this
little Volume to you.&nbsp; An opportunity, which might not
otherwise have occurred, now offers for thanking you in the name
of the poor whom you have cheered by your sympathy, and of the
rich whom you have stimulated by your example.</p>
<p>Compliments between fellow-workers are not seemly, however
humble the bestower, however illustrious the receiver.</p>
<p>That you have allowed your name to appear in these pages
cannot but be gratifying to the writer.&nbsp; The reader will
rejoice no less, and from higher than personal motives.&nbsp; He
will see in this kindness another proof of your hearty interest
in that class which, if rightly considered, is, from its very
poverty, a blessing to the land, by putting our indolence and
selfishness to shame.</p>

<h2><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Amidst</span> the excitements of political
contests at home, with wars and rumours of wars abroad, the voice
of &ldquo;Social Science&rdquo; is occasionally heard, and
listened to, with a growing conviction of its importance.&nbsp;
The Politician, the Moralist, and the Christian are impelled by
various reasons to its consideration, and will listen with equal
interest to its details.</p>
<p>Experience is always valued by practical men, and the records
of what has been done are anxiously sought, to assist our
judgment in future and more extended exertions.</p>
<p>The condition of the young, and the education of children,
naturally engaged the earliest attention of Social
Reformers.&nbsp; Experience has shewn the importance of genial
influences at home, and that it is <i>necessary</i> to improve
the homes of the poor, in order to save the children from
destruction.&nbsp; It has also been <a name="pageviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>found that <i>much</i> can be thus
effected.&nbsp; Poor women, who have been subjected to the severe
discipline of a struggling existence, are often willing and
anxious listeners to useful instruction, and are perhaps more
susceptible of good influence than younger persons who have not
felt the necessity for improvement.&nbsp; There is, therefore,
room to hope that the influence which can be brought to bear upon
the mothers of the working-classes will be a most important
element in that general elevation which it is our desire to
attain.</p>
<p>It was principally owing to this impression, and also the
great desire which I felt to do something, however feeble, to
bring more happiness and comfort into the houses of my poor
neighbours, that induced me, five or six years ago, to commence a
Mothers&rsquo; Society.&nbsp; The usual ways of helping the poor
seemed to me to effect little real good.&nbsp; The nice soup sent
for the sick man was spoiled by being smoked in the warming up,
or by the taste infused into it from the dirty saucepan: the sago
intended for the infant was burnt, or only half cooked; and
medicine and food alike failed to be efficacious in the absence
of cleanliness, and in the stifling air which the poor patient
was doomed to breathe.&nbsp; The mothers of the little, thin,
fretful babies would complain to me that they could not think why
the child did so badly, for they managed to get a rasher of bacon
for it <a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>whenever they could, and always fed it two or three
times in the night.&nbsp; I saw that the wise man was indeed
right in saying &ldquo;that knowledge is the principal
thing;&rdquo; and that if I could help them in any way to
&ldquo;get knowledge,&rdquo; it would be a gift far surpassing in
value anything else I could offer them.&nbsp; The applications
constantly made to me for information on the best modes of
establishing and conducting these Societies, induce me to suppose
that they have taken some hold on the public mind, and that these
institutions supply a want that is every day increasingly
felt.</p>
<p>The only value that can be attached to any remarks which I
have to make is, that they are the result of some years&rsquo;
experience; and that the plans which I have adopted, though
capable of great improvement, have been to some extent
successful.&nbsp; But the principal motive in my own mind for
sending these simple narratives forth into the world is, the hope
that more attention than ever may by their means be directed to
that great and difficult subject, the improvement of the homes of
the poor.&nbsp; As a few notes of a bird, the lisping of a child,
the sound of the wind dying away, have sometimes been sufficient
to awaken the spirit of harmony in some master-mind, and so led
to the composition of the music which has thrilled and delighted
all who have heard it; so, it is hoped, the suggestions <a
name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>here made may
be of use to many minds, and that anything already effected may
be as the drop to the showers, or as the first buds of spring to
the luxuriance of summer.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Give all thou canst; high Heaven rejects
the lore<br />
Of nicely calculated less and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>A <span
class="GutSmall">FEW</span> weeks ago I was visiting the Library
in the British Museum.&nbsp; Two gentlemen, who stood near me,
appeared very earnest in the pursuit of something which they
wanted.&nbsp; Presently, by an exclamation of delight, I
understood that their search had been successful; they had found
what they had sought.&nbsp; And what had they found?&nbsp; A very
old book, so badly printed as to be read with difficulty, and
containing information of what must have taken place at least two
thousand years ago&mdash;information very interesting and
important to the old Romans, no doubt; and which would have been
still more so, if they could have foreseen what delight it would
have imparted, centuries later, to two inhabitants of a remote
island in the north, who could not possibly be affected by
it.&nbsp; But so it is: some minds prefer to dwell on the past;
others live in the present; and some seem of opinion that
&ldquo;man never is, but always <i>to be</i>, blest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This diversity is no doubt necessary; all do some good: the
antiquarian adds to the interest of our libraries, if not of our
lives; and we owe much to those who teach us to look forward, if
they will only at the <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>same time help us to look upward: but
to such as wish to <i>do</i> something, who desire to have an
influence on the great living history which every day is writing
afresh, the passing events of the time have the greatest charm,
because they not only present food for reflection, but
opportunity for exertion.</p>
<p>We not unfrequently hear people speak of life in such a way as
would lead us to suppose that there had been some mistake as to
the date of their birth.&nbsp; Had they come a little earlier or
a little later, it would have been different; but the present
seems to afford them no object of interest.&nbsp; They complain
of intolerable dulness, the weariness of life; and in watching
the cheerless, the objectless existence of such people, we wonder
that it is recorded of only a single individual, that one morning
he shot himself, for the reason assigned on a slip of paper which
he had left on the dressing-table&mdash;&ldquo;I am tired of
living only to breakfast, dine, and sup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have often thought, when listening to such complaints, of
the prayer of Elisha for his unbelieving servant, &ldquo;Lord, I
pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see;&rdquo; and if the Lord
would do for them as He did for this servant, and open their
eyes&mdash;not to see &ldquo;mountains full of horses and
chariots of fire&rdquo; waiting to deliver them&mdash;but alleys,
and lanes, and villages, full of the needy and the sick, waiting
for loving hearts and kind hands to come and help them to rise
from their degradation, wretchedness, and filth,&mdash;the strain
would be changed; and, in the contemplation of such a vast <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>amount of
labour, followed by such rich reward, we should rather expect to
hear, if it must still be the language of complaint:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O wretched yet inevitable spite<br />
Of our short span! and we must yield our breath,<br />
And wrap us in the lazy coil of death;<br />
So much remaining of unproved delight!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many indications in the present day that the fields
are &ldquo;white unto harvest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several things, that
were looked upon some years ago as experiments, have been so
eminently successful, that no unprejudiced mind can doubt that
they are the means which God has blessed, and by which He intends
to accomplish a great work of reformation in this country.&nbsp;
It was a glorious sight at St Martin&rsquo;s Hall, on the 2d of
March, when 567 young persons came forward to claim the prize for
having remained a twelvemonth in a situation; and, were it not
for the strictness of the rules, excluding all apprentices,
requiring a written character from a master or mistress, it was
stated that as many as 1500 would have been present.&nbsp; All
these had been rescued from well-nigh certain destruction by the
Ragged School, and had there received the education which
qualified them to take these situations.&nbsp; There must have
been joy in the presence of the angels of God that night, as they
witnessed these rescued ones sitting together, and listening
eagerly to words by which their souls might live; and which, if
the prayers of many there were answered, would prepare them to
receive an incorruptible prize, that can never fade away.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Whilst
these facts convey resistless evidence to the mind, that these
poor outcasts <i>can</i> be lifted out of their wretchedness and
be saved, the conviction deepens, that God will hold us
responsible to do this work; and, in all the labour ever required
of our hands, it has never been so necessary that whosoever would
engage in it must be taught of the Lord.&nbsp; We have to pray
not only that the Lord of the harvest would send more labourers
into the harvest, but also that He would endow them with just the
spirit and power necessary for this particular work.&nbsp; In
noticing the physical wants and requirements of this country,
nothing strikes us more forcibly than the certainty with which
the demand creates the supply.&nbsp; No matter how intricate and
complicated the required machinery may be, heads are always to be
found clever enough to invent, and hands skilful enough to work
it.&nbsp; In fact, the degree of perfection attained in this way
is enough to make us &ldquo;proud of the age we live
in.&rdquo;&nbsp; If machinery and steam-power had been the agency
required to purify such places as St Giles&rsquo;s and Bethnal
Green, the work would have been done long ago.&nbsp; These
wretched localities have not remained so long &ldquo;like blots
in this fair world,&rdquo; without being thought of and cared
for.&nbsp; Many politicians and scientific men have asked
earnestly, &ldquo;What can be done?&rdquo; and have turned away
hopelessly, feeling that the mighty intellect which could subdue
air, earth, and sea, had now met with something beyond its power;
and still the question remained unanswered, &ldquo;What can be
done?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>One of
the most interesting discoveries of the past few years has been,
that the humblest instead of the grandest agency is required to
accomplish this work which the wisest heads have found so
difficult.&nbsp; A little sketch of the early history of one of
God&rsquo;s most successful agents will shew that &ldquo;His
thoughts are not as our thoughts;&rdquo; for it would not have
entered into the heart of man to have suggested such a
preparation for usefulness.&nbsp; &ldquo;A drunken father, who
broke her mother&rsquo;s heart, had brought a young girl of
fifteen, gradually down, down from the privileges of a
respectable station, to dwell in a low lodging-house in St
Giles&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The father died shortly afterwards, and left
her, and a sister five years of age, orphans in the midst of
pollution, which they, as by miracle, escaped; often sitting on
the stairs or door-step all night, to avoid what was to be seen
within.&nbsp; An old man, the fellow-lodger of the children, and
kind-hearted, though an Atheist, had taught the elder to write a
little, but bade her never read the Bible, since it was full of
lies; and that she had only to look around her in St
Giles&rsquo;s, and she might see that there was no God.&nbsp; She
had learned to read and knit from looking continually at the
shop-windows.&nbsp; She married at eighteen years of age her
present husband, and for the first time in her young memory knew
the meaning of that blessed word, &lsquo;home;&rsquo; although
the home was but a room, changed from time to time in the same
neighbourhood.&nbsp; After many years of considerable suffering,
from loss of children, ill-health, and other calamities, she took
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>shelter one
rainy night in an alley which led up to a little Mission Hall in
Dudley Street.&nbsp; She entered, and heard it announced that
books would be lent, on the next evening, from a newly-formed
library for the poor at that place.&nbsp; Going early, she was
the first claimant of the promise.&nbsp; She had intended to
borrow Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin; but a strong impulse came over
her, which she could not resist&mdash;it was as if she had heard
it whispered, &lsquo;Do not borrow Uncle Tom; borrow a
Bible.&rsquo;&nbsp; So she asked for a Bible.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
Bible, my good woman?&rsquo; was the missionary&rsquo;s
reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;We did not mean to lend Bibles from this
library; but wait, I will fetch you one.&nbsp; It is a token for
good that the Book of God, the best of books, should be the first
one asked for and lent from this place.&rsquo;&nbsp; He brought
her the Bible, and asked if he should call, and read a chapter
with her.&nbsp; She said respectfully, &lsquo;No, sir, thank you;
we are very quiet folk, my husband might not like it.&nbsp; I
will take the book, and read it for myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
Lord&rsquo;s time was come.&nbsp; His message then first entered
her house, and went straight to her heart.&nbsp; The Divine
Spirit applied the Word with power; and the arrow of conviction
was ere long driven home by suffering and affliction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A severe illness laid her prostrate, and to this hour
she feels&mdash;in a way that we who help her in her work cannot
feel&mdash;what is meant by sickness and poverty coming
together.&rdquo; <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a></p>
<p>This was God&rsquo;s education to prepare for Himself an <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>agent to carry
out His purposes of mercy.&nbsp; By uniting the introduction of
God&rsquo;s Word with care for the temporal wants of the poor
people around her, Marian has been able to accomplish wonders in
two short years; and the account of them will be seen with great
pleasure by those who allow themselves the monthly treat of
reading &ldquo;The Book and its Mission.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
something more than facts, valuable as they are, have been
deduced from Marian&rsquo;s mission.&nbsp; The lock that refused
to be picked, has yielded to the fitting key.&nbsp; We have sat
in our beautiful churches long enough, and wished we could see
the poor gathered around us; but they have not come.&nbsp; We
have written numberless words of advice to them from our
comfortable houses; and though all these efforts have, doubtless,
accomplished good, especially amongst a particular
class&mdash;for no word of truth falls to the ground&mdash;yet
all will acknowledge that they have in a great measure failed to
affect the masses of our poor people; and, had it not been for
our City Missionary and Ragged School, it is dreadful to think
what would have become of the ever-increasing population of this
crowded city.&nbsp; Our missionaries have done much; the moral
atmosphere is always improved by their presence; and thousands of
poor wanderers from God have, through their teaching, found their
way back to peace and holiness.&nbsp; The Ragged Schools have
rescued thousands of poor outcasts from destruction.&nbsp; But
neither of these agencies operates directly upon the homes of the
poor, though &ldquo;the entrance&rdquo; of that word which
&ldquo;giveth <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>light,&rdquo; seldom fails to shed its influence on the
exterior.</p>
<p>My acquaintance with the poor began very early.&nbsp; My
father&rsquo;s house stood alone, surrounded by beautiful lawns,
wood, and water.&nbsp; Our nearest neighbours were the poor
people in a village about five minutes&rsquo; walk from our home;
most of them were simple labouring people, and as children we
were trusted to go amongst them without much superintendence from
our elders.&nbsp; Our dear mother often employed us on errands of
mercy to them; and as soon as we could read well enough, we were
sometimes sent to cheer the solitary hours of some poor invalid
by reading to him.&nbsp; Our relations to each other were so
kindly and pleasant, that we always met with a hearty welcome;
and for years, I believe, I knew something about the interior of
every cottage in the place.&nbsp; I remember even then feeling
astonished at the wretched management I saw, especially with
regard to children; and as we did not live in any fear of one
another, I sometimes took upon myself to remark to the
&ldquo;gudewife&rdquo; that so-and-so was never done at
home.&nbsp; All this was taken in good part: the reply was
generally a laugh, and &ldquo;Law, my dear, poor people&rsquo;s
children isn&rsquo;t like gentlefolk&rsquo;s;&rdquo; or if my
observations extended to cooking or house-cleaning, it was,
&ldquo;Law, bless you, you doesn&rsquo;t know anything about
that; gentlefolks never does.&rdquo;&nbsp; Notwithstanding all
these rebukes, I still thought over these things; and have
thought over them, to a greater or less extent, ever since; and
the <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>result
is, the deliberate conviction that so long as the wives and
mothers of the poor continue such as we generally find them, we
cannot look for any very great improvement in their social
position.</p>
<p>I have known many women, under thirty years of age, with six
or eight children, so totally unqualified for almost everything
which they had to do, that I have wondered how they managed to
exist at all.&nbsp; I am now, of course, speaking of those below
the class from which we usually obtain our domestic servants; and
amongst this class, more unfit than any other for life&rsquo;s
solemn duties, the earliest marriages are contracted, apparently
without any idea that at least as much preparation is needed as
is deemed necessary for breaking stones on the road.</p>
<p>If a lady feels herself unequal to the management of her
family, she can call in the aid of nurses, governesses, and
schools; and thus her defects may in some measure be made up by
assistance from without.&nbsp; But who or what is to step in
between the poor mother and her children?&nbsp; If she cannot
train them during the first few years of infancy, they remain
untrained; and not only are the wise man&rsquo;s words proved
true, that &ldquo;a child left to itself bringeth its mother to
shame,&rdquo; but it is found that the multiplication of these
families thus left to themselves, bringeth a nation to
shame.&nbsp; When we look honestly at things as they are, we have
no right to be much surprised at such a result: it is
unreasonable to expect to reap what has never been sown.&nbsp;
Seven years of careful training is not thought <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>too much for
those who are to be employed in the making of our shoes, our
coats, or in the building of our houses.&nbsp; The education of
the men of this country is generally, from a very early age,
adapted to their future employment.&nbsp; Hence, as might be
expected, there is no lack of clever artisans, who have indeed a
higher character for cleverness than for goodness.&nbsp; But the
girl, who is to grow up to exercise an influence upon persons
more than upon things, is left to scramble on as best she can,
generally content to do as badly as those who have preceded her;
and yet, in the words of one who has thought and written much
upon the subject&mdash;&ldquo;It is to the poor man&rsquo;s wife
that we must chiefly look, when we indulge the hope of reducing
that frightful amount of crime which, with all our inventions,
discoveries, and improvements, sometimes awakens a fear that we
may not really be in so prosperous a condition, socially and
nationally, as our rapid progress in what is called civilisation
would lead a superficial observer to suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have never yet been able to see how schools, or any system
of national education, could meet this difficulty.&nbsp; That we
should be much worse than we are without them, there cannot be a
doubt.&nbsp; Our beautiful Infant Schools especially, that
shelter these little ones so many hours a day from the sight and
the sound of evil, call for a special thanksgiving to God.&nbsp;
To no class of people in this country are we more indebted than
to those high-minded Christian teachers who, with infinite
patience and self-denial, <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>manage to infuse into their teaching
such freshness, purity, and wondrous adaptation, that many a
little rebel is through them brought back to allegiance.&nbsp;
The preparation for life that boys likewise require can, to some
considerable extent, be supplied from without; but to girls,
whose education is valuable in proportion as it prepares them for
domestic duties, nothing can ever compensate for the absence of
home-training.&nbsp; The question then arises, considering that
nineteen girls out of twenty do not receive a proper
home-training, what is the best substitute for it?&nbsp; Until
some remedy for so great an evil can be found, this misery and
misfortune must continue.&nbsp; I do not pretend to answer this
question satisfactorily; I rather wish to obtain for it the
attention of wiser and clearer heads, believing that nothing can,
at the present time, exceed it in importance.&nbsp; The few
suggestions I have to make are very simple, and cannot be
considered comprehensive enough to meet such a widely extended
evil.&nbsp; If we were to see seven people struggling in the
water, and could only save one from drowning, we could not plead
as an excuse for neglecting to help that one, our inability to
rescue the six.&nbsp; In like manner, we must use the little
light that is given to us, trusting that, as we advance, more
light will be granted.</p>
<p>That which we propose to substitute should resemble, as nearly
as possible, the home-training which we find to be so sadly
deficient.&nbsp; These poor girls require friends who will supply
to them the place of mothers.&nbsp; <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Much has been said and written about
ladies devoting their leisure time to the poor, and there is no
doubt that much more good might be done by them in this way than
is done; but the work we refer to demands something far beyond
the occasional call, the book lent, and the garment cut out.</p>
<p>There are so many points of difference between the child
reared in the mansions of the wealthy, and the uncared-for,
friendless infant picked out of the streets and alleys, that it
is not strange if they should have few thoughts in common.&nbsp;
It is true there is in some hearts, as in that of Elizabeth Fry,
a sympathy strong enough to extend itself to everything with
which it comes in contact.&nbsp; The moral power of such natures
is very great: they are one of God&rsquo;s best gifts to this
fallen world, yet not the most common.&nbsp; In devising schemes
of improvement, we cannot therefore rely upon the powerful
assistance which they give; nor must we take it for granted that
our plans will be worked out by their aid.&nbsp; Probably, the
best suggestion that has been offered hitherto, is made by the
writer of &ldquo;The Book and its Mission,&rdquo; who proposes
that some of the best of the poor women, superintended by ladies,
should be employed as missionaries; and that each missionary
should be the mistress of a house, into which a number of
homeless girls might be received on payment of a small weekly
sum.&nbsp; Here, under motherly training, they might be fitted
for their future duties.</p>
<p>The Marian above alluded to, soon after the commencement <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>of her work
in St Giles&rsquo;s, says:&mdash;&ldquo;I long to lift poor young
girls, from twelve to eighteen years of age, out of the horrors
of those overcrowded rooms; and how glad I should be to take a
house and make a dormitory for them by themselves!&nbsp; I know
forty who would come to me at once, and pay threepence a night
each: they could well afford it, and it would take the money from
those dancing-rooms and casinos to which they flock to their
ruin.&nbsp; What new thoughts I might put into their minds in the
evening!&nbsp; How I might read the Bible with them! and some of
them might help me in my other work.&nbsp; There is no provision
of the sort for the class I mean; and they are those who most
want it.&nbsp; Such a change would be to them the beginning of a
new life; and there are perhaps five thousand of those girls
always growing up in St Giles&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how inadequate, some will say, are these means to meet so
extensive an evil!&nbsp; To provide for forty out of five
thousand is of little avail.&nbsp; So it, indeed, appears if we
look merely on the surface of this great subject.&nbsp; But it
must never be forgotten that, every individual is a centre of
influence.&nbsp; It is a proverb that &ldquo;one sickly sheep
infects the flock,&rdquo; but happily this law of infection is
not always on the side of evil; and, I believe, the force of
example is stronger in the class to which I am now referring,
than amongst the reading and thinking people in a higher grade of
society.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought he was right, at first,&rdquo; a
lady once said to me, &ldquo;but when I sat down by the fire <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>quietly in
the evening with my Bible, and listened to the voice within, as
well as to the teaching of the Word, I then saw it all in a
different light; and I resolved more firmly than I had ever done
before that God should be my guide, and not man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we are not speaking of the few who sit quietly by their
fireside in the evening to weigh the actions of the day in the
balance of truth; we refer to the multitude whose rule of conduct
is summed up in the words&mdash;&ldquo;Follow my
leader.&rdquo;&nbsp; True, they do not always follow the same
leader; and the defection of a comrade will cause them to
halt.&nbsp; Yet, after a time, they are found walking behind
another guide.&nbsp; They are contented even if he choose the old
path.&nbsp; But whether old or new, they cannot advance without
guidance.&nbsp; To such accustomed only to &ldquo;move altogether
if they move at all,&rdquo; we would commend the great truth that
God can work by and for the few as well as for the many; that He
is often content with small beginnings where we should have
expected mighty achievements.&nbsp; This lesson we learn from our
Saviour&rsquo;s teaching.</p>
<p>He often spoke to large audiences; but He never refrained
because His listeners were few.&nbsp; What minister charged with
such a message as, &ldquo;Whosoever drinketh the water that I
shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall
give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into
everlasting life,&rdquo; would have told it for the first time to
a poor sinful woman whom he met by the way-side?&nbsp; Would he
not rather have reasoned that his church must be unusually <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>full before
such a wonderful message could be delivered?&nbsp; Surely many
&ldquo;masters of Israel&rdquo; should have been present to hear
the answer to the question that has vexed and troubled the Church
in all ages, as to where and how the Father was to be
worshipped.&nbsp; But no; the same wondering woman, standing with
her water-pitcher in her hand, was taught that neither
exclusively &ldquo;in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem&rdquo;
was the Father to be worshipped, but that &ldquo;the true
worshippers worship the Father in spirit and in
truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jesus knew she would go on her way and stop
every one she met, to repeat what she had heard, and to say,
&ldquo;Come, see a man who told me all things that ever I
did.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, too, is our hope, when the thought
depresses us, that these small means can never affect such masses
of evil.&nbsp; Each rescued soul becomes a light set upon a hill
that cannot be hid, and many will make use of this light to guide
themselves out of darkness.</p>
<p>Let those who are actively and successfully engaged in their
own peculiar duties, spare a little time to assist their less
gifted or less fortunate neighbours.&nbsp; Let those who are
weary of doing nothing, assist those who are weak and weary with
doing too much.&nbsp; Let those who are strong, aid those whose
burden of life is too heavy for them to bear.&nbsp; And let us
all seek to fulfil the great Christian command&mdash;which should
be the bane of selfishness, and must be the foundation of social
elevation&mdash;&ldquo;Look not every man on his own things, but
every man also on the things of others.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span><span
class="smcap">The</span> wish of the child for a picture of the
story which has interested him, expresses a feeling that is found
in those of maturer years.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where did this
happen?&rdquo; is the question sure to follow a narrative that
has awakened sympathy.&nbsp; We realise the truth of a
description more forcibly when we have given to it &ldquo;a local
habitation and a name.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the present instance there
is more than the usual reason for detail.&nbsp; Characteristic
peculiarities belong both to the place and the people whom I am
about to describe.&nbsp; Origin, occupation, and habits will, to
a great extent, account for much that would otherwise require
explanation.&nbsp; Without a due regard to these particulars,
much labour is lost in working among the poor.&nbsp; We know that
the seed which flourishes in one soil, and brings forth fruit to
perfection, will scarcely live in another; and as every
successful gardener considers both ground and plant, so every
labourer in the human soil is careful to adapt means to ends, or
his toil is fruitless.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as there has always been a demand for pigs&rsquo;
flesh, at least among Christians, it is impossible <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>to determine
for how long pig-feeding establishments have been thought
necessary for the neighbourhood of London.&nbsp; In all
probability they had their origin at a very early date, and can
claim to be ranked among the &ldquo;time-honoured
institutions&rdquo; of this great city.</p>
<p>But we are not able to go back much further than sixty years,
when we find that this necessary evil had for some time been
located near the ground now covered by the Marble Arch, Connaught
and other Squares.&nbsp; Here the nuisance was supposed to be out
of town, and the porcine tribe luxuriated in this dry and
elevated region.&nbsp; If there had been found at that time a
registrar-general to note down the deaths and diseases of pigs,
the records would excite the envy of swine in the present
generation, and induce the sad belief that the former times
<i>were</i> better than these.&nbsp; But these respectable
animals of the past century had apparently another cause for
congratulation.&nbsp; Their society seemed eagerly sought by the
great London world; and seeing how perseveringly they were
followed, they could proudly boast that they were leading the
metropolis &ldquo;by the nose.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such a soothing idea
was, however, dispelled, when conviction was unwillingly forced
upon them, that there was a general desire to get rid of them as
<i>near</i> neighbours, and that their room was more highly
esteemed than their company.</p>
<p>The ground which these pigs occupied had become too valuable
for them to remain there in peace.&nbsp; I have not been able to
discover whether they were expelled by purchase, ejectment, or
annoyance; but it is <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>certain that, about the period I have
named, they were compelled to go in search of a new home.</p>
<p>About that time a man named Lake, a chimney-sweeper and
scavenger, who lived in Tottenham Court Road, became, from the
nature of his occupation, so obnoxious to his neighbours, that
he, too, was compelled to take himself off to a fresh
locality.&nbsp; My informant told me he was determined to go at
once far enough out of London.&nbsp; He thought three miles in a
westerly direction would make him safe, and finding a spot that
suited him, he secured a lease of the land, and removed himself
and his appendages to a place, now sometimes called Notting Dale,
but more generally the &ldquo;Potteries.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, for a
short time, he enjoyed almost a solitary life.&nbsp; The
population of the place, for the first year or two, consisted of
only three persons.&nbsp; Whatever he may have suffered from
loneliness, was, no doubt, abundantly made up to him by a sense
of freedom, and an absence from all restraint, for his neighbours
were distant and few.&nbsp; At length finding he could not use
all the land he had leased, he naturally looked about for some
one to share it with him.&nbsp; Alas! he was not company for
every one.&nbsp; Eventually he heard of a man named Stephens, a
bowstring maker, who, from the unsavoury nature of his trade, was
enduring a similar persecution to that from which he himself had
escaped.&nbsp; Lake invited this man to become his neighbour; and
Stephens eventually purchased from him the lease of a plot of
land for one hundred pounds, and removed his bowstring
establishment <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>to this new possession.&nbsp; Perhaps he did not find it
answer to carry on his business so far from town: this does not
appear in the narrative; but it is certain that, for some reason,
he soon relinquished it, and commenced pig-keeping
instead,&mdash;probably for the same reason as the bone-picker
assigned for his attachment to his trade, that he shouldn&rsquo;t
think it all right, unless he could &ldquo;feel a
smell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his inquiries after pigs, &amp;c., he became acquainted
with the distress of the &ldquo;West-end establishment,&rdquo;
and offered its members a share of the refuge which he and his
friend Lake had found.&nbsp; The offer was gladly accepted, and
many of the masters either bought or rented small plots of land
from the original proprietors, and removed their establishments
of pigs and children to this favoured spot, where Lake assured
them everybody should do as they liked, and &ldquo;he&rsquo;d see
that nobody meddled with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under this magnificent charter and spirited government the
little colony progressed rapidly, and numbers of houses, or
rather huts, sprang up on all sides.&nbsp; Such things as
drainage and fresh water were considered superfluous; and the
accumulation of the filth of years rendered it certain, by the
simple law of self-preservation, that nothing would be meddled
with.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned trades, about thirty years
ago a considerable plot of land was bought for brick-making, the
soil being almost entirely composed of stiff clay, peculiarly
adapted for that purpose.&nbsp; <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>This introduced another fresh element
into the newly formed colony.&nbsp; The labourers employed at
this work are not usually of a very high class, and the oldest
inhabitants of the Potteries speak of their introduction as an
evil.&nbsp; An old woman, who has lived forty years in the place,
and her husband&rsquo;s parents were amongst the first
inhabitants, remarked, &ldquo;Now pig-keepers <i>is</i>
respectable; but them brick people, they bean&rsquo;t, some of
them, no wiser than the clay they works on.&rdquo;&nbsp; I asked
this old woman what kind of life they had lived there by
themselves so many years.&nbsp; She said, &ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am,
you&rsquo;d think &rsquo;twas an awful life!&nbsp; The only
difference in Sundays and work-days was, that on Sundays we had
cock-fighting and bull-baiting, and lots of dogs were kept on
purpose to amuse the people by fighting and rat-killing.&nbsp;
People all round were afraid of these dogs, and nobody ever cared
to come nigh the place.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t ourselves venture
out after it was dark; if we hadn&rsquo;t got in all we wanted
before night, why we jist went without it: for besides the dogs,
d&rsquo;ye see, ma&rsquo;am, there was the roads; leastwise, we
called &rsquo;em roads, but they wornt for all that,&mdash;it was
jist a lot of ups and downs, and when you had put one foot down,
you didn&rsquo;t know how to pull the other one up.&nbsp; Once, I
mind, I happened to be out late in the evening, and had to go
through Cut-throat Lane jist as it was gitting dark, (they calls
that Pottery Lane now, you know, ma&rsquo;am); I heard some
people coming along, fighting and swearing, and I was so
frightened I got <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>down into the bottom of one of the ruts, and there I
stopped till they had gone; so I got a service out of them that
time, d&rsquo;ye see, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had no near neighbours for a long time; there was a
farm-house where the Mitre Tavern now stands, and I can mind,
when I have been passing by, seeing the men stacking the hay and
the corn, and hearing them singing over their work.&nbsp; Then
there was another farm-house, down where the Royal Crescent is
now; and sometimes I have been there for a drop of milk, for we
hadn&rsquo;t no shops for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew that my communicative old woman had been a good
Christian character for many years; so I asked her how she, as an
individual, had managed to pass her Sundays in this dark place,
before there were either schools or places of worship of any kind
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I never
would work of a Sunday&mdash;nobody couldn&rsquo;t make me.&nbsp;
I used to tidy up my house after breakfast, and put the saucepan
by the fire, and then I went over to the old church at
Kensington.&nbsp; The people now and then threw stones at me, and
used to threaten to set the dogs at me; but they never
did,&mdash;the Lord didn&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em; and they knew me,
too, that I&rsquo;d be torn in pieces before I&rsquo;d give up
what I knew to be right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was astonished at the immense numbers of pigs which these
people seemed to keep, and I asked the old woman how they managed
to find food for them all; she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We most of us keep a horse, or a donkey and cart, <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>and we go
round early in the morning to the gentlefolk&rsquo;s houses, and
collect the <i>refuges</i> from the kitchens.&nbsp; When we comes
home, we sorts it out; the best of it we eats ourselves or sells
it to a neighbour, the fat is all boiled down, and the rest we
gives to the pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you go to the same houses every day?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, ma&rsquo;am, that depends upon how much
<i>refuge</i> they have.&nbsp; When they have lots of company,
then they gets a deal of <i>refuge</i>.&nbsp; I have been to the
Duke of &mdash;, whenever he has been in town, for the last
thirty years.&nbsp; Last week one of his daughters was married,
and the house was full all the week; then there was plenty for
me.&nbsp; But, do you know, ma&rsquo;am, for all I&rsquo;ve been
in the habit of going backwards and forwards to that house so
many years, them servants, that they have now, never had the
manners to give me a bit of bridecake.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
help speaking about it.&nbsp; I says to them, &lsquo;Well, this
<i>is</i> something to think!&nbsp; I have been in attendance on
the Duke this thirty years, and can&rsquo;t get a bit of
bridecake when his daughter is married.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course
that wasn&rsquo;t the Duke&rsquo;s fault, you see, ma&rsquo;am;
it was all a-hoeing to them servants.&nbsp; When the families
goes out of town, the servants is put upon board wages, and they
skrimps and saves everything; we aint wanted to call then,
&rsquo;cause there&rsquo;s not a scrap left for us.&nbsp; Oh no,
it aint no use then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although, as years rolled on, London continued to come further
out of town, till those pig-feeders found <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>themselves
again surrounded by streets, squares, and terraces, inhabited by
the &ldquo;quality,&rdquo; little attention was directed to the
place, till the visitation of cholera in 1849.&nbsp; Then the
eyes of the newly arrived were opened, and many were horrified at
discerning what a plague-spot they had in their midst.</p>
<p>In one of the first numbers of Dickens&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Household Words&rdquo; the following passages appeared,
which at once brought the place into notice; and, both in and out
of Parliament, plans for its improvement were
discussed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In a neighbourhood studded thickly with
elegant villas and mansions, viz., Bayswater and Notting Hill, in
the parish of Kensington, is a plague-spot, scarcely equalled for
its insalubrity by any other in London; it is called the
Potteries.&nbsp; It comprises some seven or eight acres, with
about two hundred and sixty houses (if the term can be applied to
such hovels), and a population of nine hundred or one
thousand.&nbsp; The occupation of the inhabitants is principally
pig-fattening.&nbsp; Many hundreds of pigs, ducks, and fowls, are
kept in an incredible state of filth.&nbsp; Dogs abound, for the
purpose of guarding the swine.&nbsp; The atmosphere is still
further polluted by the process of fat-boiling.&nbsp; In these
hovels, discontent, dirt, filth, and misery are unsurpassed by
anything known even in Ireland.&nbsp; Water is supplied to only a
small number of the houses.&nbsp; There are foul ditches, open
sewers, and defective drains, smelling most offensively, and
generating large quantities of poisonous gases; stagnant <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>water is
found at every turn; not a drop of clean water can be obtained;
all is charged to saturation with putrescent matter.&nbsp; Wells
have been sunk on some of the premises, but they have become in
many instances useless, from organic matter soaking into
them.&nbsp; In some of the wells the water is perfectly black and
fetid.&nbsp; The paint on the window-frames has become black from
the action of sulphuretted hydrogen gas.&nbsp; Nearly all the
inhabitants look unhealthy; the women especially complain of
sickness and want of appetite, their eyes are sunken, and their
skin shrivelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poisonous influence of this pestilential locality
extends far and wide.&nbsp; Some twelve or thirteen hundred feet
off, there is a row of clean houses called Crafton Terrace: the
situation, though rather low, is open and airy.&nbsp; On Saturday
and Sunday, the 8th and 9th September 1849, the inhabitants
complained of an intolerable stench, the wind then blowing
directly upon the terrace from the Potteries.&nbsp; Up to this
time, there had been no case of cholera among the inhabitants;
but the next day the disease broke out virulently; and, on the
following day, the 11th September, a child died of cholera at No.
1.&nbsp; By the 22d of the same month, no less than seven persons
in the terrace lost their lives by this fatal malady.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be supposed that, after this, the law of
self-preservation induced the surrounding inhabitants to be very
urgent with parochial and all other officials who had any
authority in the place.&nbsp; In a short time a good road was
made, and supplies of fresh water were <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>introduced.&nbsp; The drainage was
found very difficult, from the low level of the ground; and it
certainly could not have been thoroughly completed; for in the
Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Parish of Kensington, for
the year 1856, by Francis Goderich, M.R.C.S., L.A.C., Medical
Officer of Health, the following passages appear:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One of the most deplorable spots, not only
in Kensington, but in the whole metropolis, is the Potteries at
Notting Dale,&mdash;a locality which is from its position
difficult to drain.&nbsp; It occupies eight or nine acres of
ground, and contains about 1000 inhabitants, the majority of whom
obtain a living by rearing and fattening pigs upon the
house-refuse obtained from club-houses and hotels, and upon
offal, entrails, liver, and blood from slaughter-houses.&nbsp;
This offensive food, often in a high state of decomposition when
brought to the place, is boiled down in coppers and the fat
separated for sale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The number of pigs varies from 1000 to 2000 (as many as
3000 have been kept), in filthy and badly-paved styes close to
the houses.&nbsp; The drainage, in nearly all cases very
defective, permits the liquid manure to run over the yards,
saturating the ground to a great depth, contaminating all the
wells with putrid matter, and polluting the atmosphere for a
considerable distance around.&nbsp; There were, till lately,
several immense accumulations of stagnant water, into which this
pig matter found its way.&nbsp; One immense piece, called the
&lsquo;Ocean,&rsquo; formerly occupied nearly an <a

ground; it was covered with filthy slime, and bubbling with
poisonous gases, caused by the drainage of pigstyes, &amp;c.,
flowing into it.&nbsp; Till lately, the want of water was most
severely felt by the inhabitants, and even now many of the yards
in which the pigs are kept are entirely destitute of it.&nbsp;
Many of the houses are in a most dilapidated state.&nbsp; Old
railway-carriages and worn-out travelling-vans may be seen taken
off their wheels and converted into dwellings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people in general look sallow and aged; the
children pale and flabby, their eyes glistening as if stimulated
by ammonia.&nbsp; Small-pox is ten times more fatal than in any
of the surrounding districts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general death-rate varies from forty to sixty per
1000 per annum; of these deaths the very large proportion of 87.5
per cent. are under five years of age; and nearly all the deaths,
I again observe, occur from zymotic diseases.&nbsp; The most
appalling fact, however, connected with this subject, and one
most likely to make a deep sensation in the public mind, is, that
for a period of three years the average age at death is under
twelve years.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this, great efforts were made to get rid of &ldquo;the
swinish multitude&rdquo; altogether; but the shrewd
chimney-sweep, Lake, seems to have foreseen this evil day, and
&ldquo;for the purpose of pig-keeping&rdquo; had been inserted in
the very leases which the people were able to produce; so that
nothing but a special Act of Parliament could remedy the existing
evil.&nbsp; The number of animals was, however, somewhat reduced;
and, by additional drainage <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>and further supplies of fresh water,
a decided improvement has been effected.&nbsp; The inhabitants
have become much healthier, and for the last year or two the
number of deaths has scarcely exceeded the common average.</p>
<p>So much for the physical aspect of the district.&nbsp; But
another question arises, fraught with still greater
interest.&nbsp; What has been done for the people
themselves?&nbsp; Surely the moral as well as the physical
drainer had work to do here.&nbsp; However scanty may have been
the supply of fresh water, the &ldquo;water of life&rdquo; was
still more scarce.&nbsp; The road to heaven, though it had not to
be made for them, had to be pointed out.&nbsp; In the almost
entire absence of the observance of the Sabbath and of the means
of grace, it is not surprising that a generation should have
grown up without God in the world, and to all outward appearance
as &ldquo;far off by wicked works&rdquo; as any of the heathen
nations.</p>
<p>When, however, the place began to be frequented by the
district visitor, it was found that a few, even there, had from
the first feared and honoured God, had kept His Sabbaths in spite
of all opposition; and though their cry had been, &ldquo;Woe is
me that I dwell in Meshec,&rdquo; yet they had held fast their
integrity, and, in a few cases, had managed even to establish in
their families the daily reading of the Bible and united
prayer.&nbsp; I have had the pleasure of conversing with some of
these good people; and it might as truly be said of their moral
standing, as it was of Saul&rsquo;s natural height, that <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>&ldquo;from
their shoulders and upwards&rdquo; they were higher than any of
the people.</p>
<p>The first girls&rsquo; school in the Potteries was established
through the benevolent exertions of Lady Mary Fox.&nbsp; Some
time after its foundation, a gentleman, who took a deep interest
in the improvement of the district, presented a plot of ground on
which a spacious national school-room was soon erected.&nbsp; It
was, and is still (1859), surrounded by pigstyes.&nbsp; St
James&rsquo;s Church was built in 1845, within a few
minutes&rsquo; walk of these school-rooms.</p>
<p>The first curate who was appointed entered at once upon his
work in this deplorably destitute district, and in spite of great
difficulties, and frequent failures of health, from exposure to
damp and the horrible pollutions and stench of the highways and
byways, he has steadily worked on for twelve years.&nbsp; He has
happily lived to see a great improvement since he commenced his
labours, and he has won the respect and affection of the whole
community.&nbsp; The old woman, from whose conversation I have
before quoted, said, in speaking of him, &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas the
best day that ever rose in the Potteries, when he came amongst
us; and, let who will come after him, <i>he&rsquo;ll</i> never be
forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another happy event was the appointment of a City Missionary,
in the year 1850.&nbsp; It was pre-eminently the missionary that
those people required.&nbsp; Their early habits, and also a
spirit of lawlessness which seems one of their natural
characteristics, made it difficult to persuade <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>them to
attend any place of worship.&nbsp; They had, indeed, to be
&ldquo;sought out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been remarked of the people in the United States of
America, that they are all, to some extent, tinctured with the
spirit of their early founders.&nbsp; The indomitable spirit, the
resolution to conquer difficulties at any cost, is traced back by
some to &ldquo;the Pilgrim Fathers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those who reason
thus would perhaps think they could account in the same way for
that extraordinary spirit of independence which is so manifest in
the dispositions of the people of whom we are now writing.&nbsp;
The descendants of Lake and Stephens would, if placed in the same
difficulties, undoubtedly exhibit the same ingenuity and
resolution to extricate themselves.&nbsp; Another cause of this
independence may be, that they have remained very much their own
masters.&nbsp; Each man and woman seems to have had so many pigs
and children to rule over, and no one dared to interfere.&nbsp;
This absence of service, each one having to think for himself,
and not to conform to the dictates of another, would also cause
unusual self-reliance.</p>
<p>Fortunately for this people, the missionary soon made himself
thoroughly acquainted with the soil he had come to cultivate, and
was enabled so to accommodate and adapt himself to its
requirements, that very little time was lost in getting to
work.&nbsp; Had the case been otherwise, years might have passed
in fruitless labour; but God gave to His servant a wise and
understanding heart, and by appearing to yield everything, he
gained everything.&nbsp; Among the many <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>triumphs of
missionary work, the Potteries must rank almost the
highest.&nbsp; A contrast more striking could scarcely be
imagined than that between the indifference, rudeness, and
sometimes even execration, with which his first visits were
received, and the spontaneous respect which is now paid to him by
every man, woman, and child.</p>
<p>But other agencies for good have also been at work.&nbsp; The
church and congregation assembling at Horbury Chapel directed
their kind sympathies, and stretched out helping hands to cleanse
this &ldquo;Slough of Despond.&rdquo;&nbsp; A room was first
hired, in which to conduct a Sunday school; but this was soon
overfilled, and it was proposed to build a chapel and
school-rooms.&nbsp; By the exertion of kind and influential
friends, the proposal was carried out, and the building was
opened in 1852.&nbsp; An excellent master and mistress for the
schools were secured: it is not too much to say that their
influence for good is felt through the length and breadth of the
district.</p>
<p>I was present at a meeting held at Kensington Chapel some time
since, when a report of these schools was read.&nbsp; In
describing the first gathering of the children, it was remarked
that the scholars who regularly attended soon became orderly and
attentive; the annoyance which was at first experienced arose not
from them, but from the ragged, neglected children without, who
for a long time persisted in throwing stones, breaking windows,
persecuting the scholars as they came and returned, and in other
varieties of characteristic <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>mischief.&nbsp; From these facts it
was evident that while the &ldquo;aristocracy&rdquo; of the
Potteries had education provided for their children, there still
existed an outlying juvenile population of young Ishmaelites, to
reach whom some other means must be devised.&nbsp; After a short
time, a room was hired, and a Ragged Evening School for girls was
established; a Mothers&rsquo; Class soon followed, then a Sunday
Evening Ragged School for boys, a Working Men&rsquo;s
Association, and other like institutions.&nbsp; All these, from
want of a suitable place for assembling, were maintained with
considerable difficulty, and also with great expense.&nbsp; This
want continued to be so increasingly felt, that in June 1855, a
lady in the neighbourhood kindly convened a meeting of
influential ladies and gentlemen at her house, to consider the
possibility of erecting such a building.&nbsp; At this meeting,
the following resolutions were unanimously carried:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;1st, That should such school-rooms be
raised, they should be placed in trust of a committee of
evangelical Christians, to consist of members of the Church of
England and Dissenters in equal numbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2d, That they should be for the benefit of four chief
objects:&mdash;the Boys&rsquo; Ragged School, the Girls&rsquo;
Ragged School, the Infant School, and the Mothers&rsquo;
Meetings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3d, It is also considered important that the use of the
building should be granted for lectures and for general
educational purposes.&nbsp; The means of carrying out these
resolutions are left for decision till a future
meeting.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Upwards
of one hundred pounds were subscribed on this occasion; but,
though great exertions were made to obtain the requisite funds,
it was not until March 1858, that the committee considered they
had a sufficient amount in hand to warrant the prosecution of
their design.&nbsp; In the list of contributors to the Building
Fund will be found names of members of the Established Church,
the Society of Friends, Independents, Wesleyans, and
Baptists.&nbsp; It is the determination of the committee to carry
out the first resolution in its strictest integrity, trusting
that all the members will be enabled to act in harmonious concert
in the one grand object of promoting the moral and religious
training of the poor people of the Potteries.&nbsp; The Infant
and Ragged School-rooms, erected under the able direction of Mr
Sim, the Honorary Architect, are remarkable alike for simplicity
of design, excellence of ventilation, and space.&nbsp; They were
opened by Lord Shaftesbury in June.</p>

<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span><span
class="smcap">In</span> my first visit to the Potteries, I was
accompanied by the City Missionary, who introduced me to some
fourteen or sixteen families residing there.</p>
<p>I was, as usual, at once impressed with the great deficiency
of home comforts; and the miserable countenances of many of the
children told of neglect and bad management more forcibly than
words could have done.</p>
<p>I told them I had just come to reside near them, and I hoped
we should be good neighbours.&nbsp; Like them, I was so occupied
with my home duties, that I feared I should not be able to visit
them frequently; but it had occurred to me, that if they could
spare an hour one evening in the week, I would try to do so also,
and we would spend it together in conversing over our various
duties and difficulties, more especially those relating to our
children, and by this means I hoped we might mutually benefit
each other, as well as get more intimately acquainted.</p>
<p>This invitation was by no means warmly responded to at first,
but it was the first step taken towards the formation of the
Kensington Potteries Mothers&rsquo; Society.</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>One
morning, a very decent elderly woman, whom I had seen at the
Mothers&rsquo; Meetings, asked me to call upon her husband, who
had not been able to leave his house for some weeks, and was too
ill to read.&nbsp; In the afternoon I went to the
Potteries.&nbsp; Fortunately, I met a boy of my acquaintance in
the street, and he conducted me to the dwelling, which, with the
direction given me that &ldquo;it was in no street in
particular,&rdquo; would have proved difficult to find.&nbsp; I
had to pass through a kind of shed to reach the room in which
this old couple lived; it was filled with feeding-troughs, tubs,
old hoops, and wheel-barrows.&nbsp; I managed to steer safely
through all this, and ascended two or three steps into the one
chamber which served at once for bed-room, kitchen, and
living-room.&nbsp; The man was sitting in a comfortable arm-chair
by a neat little fire, and the room was very clean.&nbsp; His
hair was perfectly white, and scantily covered one of the
finest-formed heads I have ever seen.&nbsp; The features of his
face were of a very uncommon order, and everything marked him as
one of nature&rsquo;s &ldquo;men of power.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
scarcely noticed me when I entered; but his wife said,
&ldquo;This is the lady, John, as has the meeting.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He said, &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; and gave me a kind of nod.&nbsp; The
woman seemed annoyed at his want of cordiality, and said again,
&ldquo;John, I have told you about the lady often, and I went
myself this morning to ask her to come and see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; was the laconic answer.</p>
<p>I saw the first advances must come from me, so I <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>took a seat
by him, and said, &ldquo;I am sorry to hear you have been
suffering from illness so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am seventy-five years old; I have hardly had any
illness all my life; I have done a deal of work, and God has been
very good to me, and I am not going to grumble at Him now for
shutting me up a few months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wife tells me you cannot read much, on account of
your eyes; I suppose you find the time a little tedious after the
active life you have led?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t find the time tedious at all, if we
were only left to ourselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked to the wife
for an explanation, and she said, &ldquo;He means, ma&rsquo;am,
that the neighbours hereabout annoy him so by their ways of going
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; This touched a theme upon which he could be
eloquent.&nbsp; He began to tell me a great deal about the
wickedness of his neighbours; their desecration of the Sabbath
seemed to vex him exceedingly.&nbsp; He complained that he could
get no peace on the Sunday for the cries of those who went about
selling things; while the swarms of children that came out to
spend their halfpence that day shewed how wicked their parents
must be.&nbsp; As I generally avoid talking of the faults of
other persons when visiting the poor, I said, wishing to change
the subject, &ldquo;Well, we have so much to do with ourselves
that we must not judge our neighbours harshly.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
old man looked indignantly at me, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Do you
think if God was to call me away this instant, and I had to go to
be judged before His throne, and He was to tell me of all the
wicked ways I <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>have seen going on before my eyes, and He was to say to
me, &lsquo;Why did you see all that sin, and not reprove
it?&rsquo; do you think He&rsquo;d take for excuse my saying,
&lsquo;that I oughtn&rsquo;t to judge my neighbours
harshly?&rsquo;&nbsp; No; depend upon it, He&rsquo;d hold me
guilty for it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;You know&rsquo;d
better, and you ought to have cared for their souls, and told
&rsquo;em of it.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have always been in the habit of
reproving sin when I have seen it, and I always shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The character of Nehemiah came so forcibly into my mind while
he was speaking, that when he had ended I could not help
remarking, &ldquo;If you had lived in the days of Nehemiah, I
suppose you would not have disapproved of what he did?&nbsp; You
know, he not only reproved the people, but he smote certain of
them, and plucked out their hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;he was in the right
of it.&nbsp; Whenever I reads that, I always says, &lsquo;Sarved
&rsquo;em right.&rsquo;&nbsp; We want Nehemiahs bad enough
now-a-days,&mdash;people, I mean, as has got the courage to call
things by their right names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;we have a later example
than Nehemiah to go by, and a more perfect one.&nbsp; Jesus did
not reprove sin in this way.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He made a whip
of small cords and drove them all out of the temple, I
know,&rdquo; said the old man.&mdash;&ldquo;So He did
once,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but a whip of small cords in the
hands of Jesus is a very different thing from what it would be in
our hands.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand
you,&rdquo; was the rejoinder.&mdash;I explained, &ldquo;Jesus
would only use it <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>where and when it ought to be used, because He would
know the extent of the evil in every heart He had to do with; but
we, who can judge only after the outward appearance, might make
mistakes, and inflict a wound where we ought rather to have bound
one up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent a minute, and then, as if unable to keep in any
longer what had evidently been in his thoughts throughout, he
said, &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;ve often heard from my old
&rsquo;ooman and the rest of &rsquo;em what you says to &rsquo;em
at the meetings, and it has been upon my mind, when I did see
you, to tell you I think, if you know&rsquo;d more about some of
&rsquo;em you get there, you would be rather more sharp upon
&rsquo;em than you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, I suppose, that when I know of anything
particularly wrong in any of them, I ought to reprove
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes.&nbsp; You see, they look up to you a good
deal; and, it seems to me, you might do a power of good this
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you do not take quite the right view of my
position.&nbsp; I do not profess to come amongst them as a
reprover of sin, and just to preach to them about their duties; I
really have no right to take such an office on myself.&nbsp; I
want to help them, knowing that many of their mistakes arise from
ignorance.&nbsp; Most of them come in after a hard day&rsquo;s
work, and much suffering in body and mind from fatigue and
anxiety; and while I know much of that fatigue and anxiety <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>might have
been prevented, if they had set about things in a right way
instead of a wrong one, I feel the best use I can make of the
little time we have together is, to try to shew them &lsquo;a
better way.&rsquo;&nbsp; We always begin with reading God&rsquo;s
holy Word, and that is the best reprover of sin; for Paul says,
you know, &lsquo;I had not known sin, except by the
law.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was the <i>law</i> that made sin appear to
him &lsquo;exceeding sinful;&rsquo; and that is the effect I hope
and pray it may have upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;some of &rsquo;em
is a deal better for going, I must confess; but it &rsquo;pears
to me you say things to them as if they were all alike, whereas
some of them is a deal wickeder than others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw it would be quite impossible to separate in the mind of
this veteran the offices of teacher of righteousness, and
reprover of sin, or to make him comprehend how many enemies I
should make, and what confusion there would be, if I adopted the
course which he recommended.&nbsp; So I just remarked,
&ldquo;Well, you know I always ask God to give me a wise and
understanding heart before I go amongst them, and I hope I shall
be guided to do what is right.&nbsp; If I could see into the
heart as God can, I might be able to adapt myself to individual
cases; but as it is, I think it would be a worse mistake to
distress and vex, by unjust comments, those already sufficiently
weary and heavy laden.&nbsp; Encouragement in a right course will
often do much more than finding fault with what is wrong.&nbsp; I
believe, that whatever good has been done, has arisen from the <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>reading
together of God&rsquo;s Word; whether comfort, counsel, or
reproof has been wanted, they have come in this way, and the
promise has been fulfilled, &lsquo;My word shall not return unto
me void.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that blessed book!&nbsp; I
have lived in this place through a dark time, and I am sure I can
say that it has been &lsquo;a light to my feet, and a lamp to my
path.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Just then a sad fit of coughing came
on, which seemed almost to deprive him of the power of
breathing.&nbsp; When it was over, I said, &ldquo;Do you often
cough like that?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I often do in the
night,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can never quite lie
down; for if the cough were to come on suddenly, I might be
choked before I could be got up.&nbsp; The doctor says I shall go
off in one of these fits some night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked the wife if any one was with them at night: she said,
&ldquo;Oh, no, John isn&rsquo;t never afraid.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The last thing that I and my old &rsquo;ooman does at
night,&rdquo; added John, &ldquo;is to kneel down and commend
ourselves to God&rsquo;s keeping.&nbsp; I said to her last night,
after we had been praying, &lsquo;Jane, if I am sent for
to-night, I am ready;&rsquo; and what it will be to leave this
poor place, and go right off at once to the mansion my Saviour
has provided for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you feel as trustful as your husband?&rdquo; I
asked Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am, I do try to, and I am as happy to
think about heaven as he is; but you see, ma&rsquo;am, the thing
I feel is, that we must die first before we can go there, and
death may be an awfuller thing than we think for.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>&ldquo;Jane,&rdquo; cried her husband, in a reproving
tone of voice, &ldquo;how often I have told you, that if death is
to be a great trouble, then God is going to send us great help
for it.&nbsp; He took care of me and helped me when I was a
strong man, and now that I am as feeble as a child, He will be
strength to me; and, Jane, I wish you would mind, that it
isn&rsquo;t any more hard to God to help us out of great troubles
than out of little uns.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t believe,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;how happy I am at night,
sometimes, when I am lying awake.&nbsp; He makes me to feel that
love and trust in Him, that as sure as David I can say, &lsquo;I
fear no evil.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blessed old man!&nbsp; The little room, with its close
atmosphere, and many discomforts, seemed to me like the gate of
heaven; and had he lived in Old Testament days, his name might
have ranked with them of whom it is said, &ldquo;These all died
in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them
afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and
confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few months after I had established the Mothers&rsquo;
Society, one of the women brought a message from her husband,
expressing his great wish to see me.&nbsp; I promised to call in
the course of the week, and the next afternoon I found my way to
a little low dwelling, which was pointed out to me as the
residence I was seeking.&nbsp; It consisted of only two
rooms&mdash;one in front, where the family seemed to live during
the day, while <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>that behind served as a bed-room.&nbsp; Three or four
children were playing on the floor; the mother was busy at her
washing-tub; and near the fire sat the husband, who, I saw, from
his leather apron and the boot he held in his hand, was a
shoemaker.&nbsp; The reception here was very different from the
one previously described.&nbsp; When the wife announced me, the
man rose from his seat; and, as his height exceeded six feet, his
head scarcely cleared the ceiling.&nbsp; His fine figure, the
form of his head, and the expression of his countenance, conveyed
the idea that, had the man been born in a different position, he
might have risen to be Lord Chancellor.&nbsp; After the usual
greeting, he said (still standing)&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, I have wanted to see you for some time past, to
thank you for what you have begun to do for us.&nbsp; You have
thought of what we want done for us more than anything, and I
hope, madam, you will go on with it; and God will bless you for
this work, and so shall many of us; for we often think we might
do better, if somebody would take the trouble to put us in the
way of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him that I was quite rewarded for any trouble which I
was taking, by the pleasant friends I made.&nbsp; When I was
living in the country, I had always been accustomed to a large
number of poor friends; and since coming to London, I had missed
them very much.&nbsp; I told him of a book society that my
brother and I had established in the village near our
house.&nbsp; Twelve men, like himself, (I believe, four out of
the <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>twelve
were shoemakers,) each brought a book, and on the first day of
the month each man passed on his book to the member next on the
list; and thus all had the benefit of reading twelve books at the
cost of one.&nbsp; We had quarterly meetings with these men, to
converse about the books; I repeated to him some of the
observations they used to make, and I saw my listener was much
amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I lived in the country, too,
before I came here; but there was nothing of that sort going on
there.&nbsp; I wish there had; it would have kept me out of a
deal of mischief.&nbsp; I have blessed God that ever I came to
this place; for though it is poor and dirty enough, I have met
the best friends here that I ever knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then gave me a long and interesting account of his previous
life; how he had early imbibed infidel principles from some of
his companions, and had gone on for years rather wishing them to
be true than actually believing them to be so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t bear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to think
there was a God, or another life to come after this; it made me
so miserable.&nbsp; I was obliged to try and get rid of the
thoughts as fast as they came; and then there was the people as
called themselves religious; I really couldn&rsquo;t see that
they were better than those as didn&rsquo;t say anything about
it.&nbsp; They liked eating, and drinking, and pleasuring, just
as much in their way as any one else; and though we often heard
that they talked about us in a way that shewed they despised us,
and thought themselves a deal better, that only made us <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>feel
worse.&nbsp; But since we have been here, some of the ladies as
bring round the tracts has stopped and talked to us sometimes in
quite a different sort of way, you know, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; One
of them left me a tract to read some time ago.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t get this tract out of my mind after I had read
it.&nbsp; There, whilst I was at work, it was lying on the bench,
and I kept looking into it again and again.&nbsp; One day, while
I was puzzling about it, the missionary came in.&nbsp; I soon saw
he wasn&rsquo;t like them religious people I knew before, and I
told him all that was in my mind: and &rsquo;twas the best day of
my life when I met with him; for he has helped me to see things
very different; and I bless God that ever he came here, and so
does many others beside me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you can say you are a
happier man now than ever you were before, cannot you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, thank God, I can trust Him for this
life, and through my blessed Saviour I have hope of a better life
to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw, by the thoughtful and earnest expression of his face,
that the man had still something on his mind; so I did not reply,
but waited a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;though God has been so good to me, and has made me to see
how He can and will save me, sinner though I am, it do trouble
me, and I can&rsquo;t help it, to see so much confusion, like, in
this world.&nbsp; Some people as isn&rsquo;t worse than others,
nor yet so bad, seems to be always a-suffering; and little
children too, it do grieve me to <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>see them suffer: and then you see,
ma&rsquo;am, what a place this very &lsquo;Potteries&rsquo; is,
to be in God&rsquo;s world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;God did not make the
Potteries what they are.&nbsp; Some sixty years ago, before any
one lived here, the air was fresh and sweet; flowers and trees
were growing here; and it was altogether as pleasant a place as
any other portion of God&rsquo;s dominions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s true:&rdquo;
but the shade had not passed away from his countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;it is one of
the greatest troubles of my life that I so often feel just what
you describe.&nbsp; It was only a short time ago, I was walking
in London; and as I turned into one of the back streets, I saw a
little boy sitting on a doorstep, with a baby in his arms about
five or six months old; as I passed by, the baby began to cry,
and the miserable expression of its little face, and the hopeless
look of its nurse, feeling so powerless to do anything to comfort
it,&mdash;both little faces looking already old from hunger,
cold, and neglect,&mdash;so troubled me that I could scarcely
look at or enjoy anything while I was out.&nbsp; In the evening,
after my own healthy, happy children were gone to bed, I was
sitting in my comfortable room by the cheerful fire, surrounded
by everything to make life comfortable and desirable; but instead
of feeling thankful for so many mercies, I sat and cried at the
recollection of those unhappy little children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did ye sure, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; said the
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Law! <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>now, how we do feel alike after all,
when we come to know!&nbsp; But I suppose, ma&rsquo;am, that sort
of thing does not last long with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember, that evening at family prayer,&rdquo; I
continued, &ldquo;the chapter which was read had this verse in
it: &lsquo;Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in
heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I thought it was not my will, either; but there was this great
difference,&mdash;whatever God <i>willed</i> He had the
<i>power</i> to do; that He had sent His Son to die for the
world, and these little creatures were part of His world, and He
would do with them just what is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the man,
&ldquo;that God is altogether angry with us for this sort of
feeling?&nbsp; He must know that it is very difficult for us to
see so much misery, and not be troubled about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think that is quite so clear,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;as that He is pleased with us for trusting Him
entirely.&nbsp; I think He has great sympathy with us in the
difficulty we have to contend with in this respect.&nbsp; He
says, &lsquo;And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Though He did not blame Thomas for his unbelief,
He said, &lsquo;Blessed are they who have not seen me, and yet
have believed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Even a grain of faith is commended,
and spoken of as having much reward connected with it: and the
apostle tells us, &lsquo;Cast not away, therefore, your
confidence, which hath <i>great recompense of
reward</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I do pray
for faith.&nbsp; I do think it is a glorious thing to be able to
trust everything <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>with God.&nbsp; I says to myself often, &lsquo;There,
wait a bit, and you&rsquo;ll know.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered, &ldquo;I once heard my dear mother talking to a
person who troubled himself very much about the management of
God&rsquo;s world.&nbsp; She said, &lsquo;I have often compared
our present condition to that of servants who might be called
into a great house to assist in performing some important work;
but instead of the same servants being employed throughout, each
was expected to work only one hour, and then to give place to
others.&nbsp; Of course, from this circumstance, no one of them
would be able to understand the object and design of the work;
these would only be known to the master.&nbsp; All that he
required of them was, to do his bidding a little while, and then
to receive a great reward.&nbsp; How foolish it would be of those
servants to go fretfully through their short period of service,
and dishonour their master by evil reports of what they could not
understand, and lose their reward at last!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;that is
beautiful: it was never so plain to me before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the children, who had been sent out by their mother
to play, that they might not interrupt our conversation,
returned; and, after making a little acquaintance with them, I
took my leave.&nbsp; As I returned home, I hoped that this
pleasant interview might be the beginning of a long friendship;
but I never saw my friend again.&nbsp; Only about a week from
that time, he was taken ill, and died a few days
afterwards.&nbsp; I did not hear of his sickness in time to see
him; but I heard <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>that he died in peace, trusting wholly in the
Saviour.&nbsp; How soon was the mystery, with him, exchanged for
perfect knowledge!&nbsp; How soon was he admitted where every
tear shed, either for himself or others, was for ever wiped away;
while we, who tried even out of our own dimness and sorrow to
enlighten and comfort him, are still left to wonder and weep!</p>
<p>Foster, after the death of his wife, when writing to a friend,
says, referring to the years that may elapse before he may be
permitted to join her, &ldquo;Does that to her appear a long time
in prospect, or has she begun to account of duration according to
the great laws of eternity?&nbsp; Earnest imaginings and
questionings like these arise without end, and still, still there
is no answer, no revelation.&nbsp; The mind comes again and again
up closer to the thick black veil; but there is no perforation,
no glimpse.&nbsp; She that loved me, and, I trust, loves me
still, will not, must not, cannot answer me.&nbsp; I can only
imagine her to say, &lsquo;Come and see.&nbsp; Serve our God, so
that you shall come and share at no distant
time.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, in another letter, he says,
&ldquo;How striking to think that <i>she</i>, so long and so
recently with me here, so beloved, but now so totally withdrawn
and absent, that she experimentally knows all that I am in vain
inquiring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cottage of the communicative little old woman, to whom I
am indebted for so much of my information, was amongst the
earliest erected in the Potteries.&nbsp; It must have been a
picturesque object when the smoke first curled from the low
chimney across the verdant <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>plain, where neither villa, terrace,
nor steeple were to be seen.&nbsp; The Hippodrome was then on the
spot where the graceful church of Saint John&rsquo;s now
stands.&nbsp; Travellers, who were in the habit of coming this
way, tell us <i>that</i> was then the waymark, just as the church
now seems to be the town-mark.</p>
<p>Not far from the Hippodrome stood &ldquo;Tucker&rsquo;s
Cottage,&rdquo; which an artist thought sufficiently picturesque
to transfer to his sketch-book.&nbsp; The reader may confirm this
opinion on reference to my frontispiece.&nbsp; This interesting
dwelling consisted of one floor, divided into two apartments, one
for the family, the other for domestic purposes and such animals
as were thought indispensable to the general welfare.&nbsp;
Before and behind was an ample plot of ground, enclosed by a
thick mound of earth that resembled the outworks of a
fortification.&nbsp; The ground front was the domain of poultry,
pigs, and the donkey; in the rear stagnated a lake, into which
flowed the foul streams of the province.&nbsp; The pond was
overhung with willow stumps, that assumed the title of
trees.&nbsp; Like a sea far more famous, it had &ldquo;no outlet
but the ambient air.&rdquo;&nbsp; As years passed, and the events
previously described took place, this primeval cottage was fast
advancing to decay.&nbsp; The roof and walls had been often
repaired with old pieces of board, condemned teatrays, plaster,
and similar rubbish; the windows had become opaque, and the
chimney transparent.&nbsp; Various means had been adopted to
prevent the downfall of the whole house.&nbsp; After a
&ldquo;stiffer breeze&rdquo; than common, the <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>little old
man might have been seen doctoring Jenny&rsquo;s (the
donkey&rsquo;s) apartment, and his own also.&nbsp; But all his
trouble and pains were unavailing.&nbsp; The little dwelling,
which he and his &ldquo;guidwife&rdquo; had helped to rear with
their own hands, laughed at by the world, but endeared to them by
the associations of a lifetime, was sentenced by the
Commissioners to be taken down; and thus, just five years before
the expiration of their lease, the venerable pair were compelled,
at a cost to themselves of thirty shillings (which they could
very ill afford), to pull down what remained of the old
fabric.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some natural tears they shed, but wiped them
soon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, literally, they &ldquo;wiped them
soon;&rdquo; for the poor old couple belonged to the company of
the faithful, who believe that &ldquo;here they have no
continuing city, but seek one to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
&ldquo;the Lord&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; they said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
ordered all for the best.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Master would
soon call them to a house not made with hands;&rdquo; and so,
without repining, they rented an adjoining cottage.&nbsp; Here
the principal inconvenience was, that &ldquo;grannie,&rdquo; in
her old age, had scarcely room to stretch her weary limbs: so
narrow was the new domicile, that the chain of the faithful dog
had to be shortened, against his wishes; and the poor ducks and
hens, accustomed to a more ample domain, could scarcely find a
roosting-place.</p>
<p>There is yet another member of this little family who must not
be forgotten.&nbsp; A deaf and blind sister has long received
shelter in this humble home, where no charitable aid has entered,
or parochial relief intrudes.&nbsp; <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>Though feeling is the only avenue of
access to this afflicted one, she shares their family
devotions.&nbsp; The Bible is brought to her, and she passes her
hands over it, and then places them in the attitude of prayer, in
which she always keeps them a certain time.&nbsp; After they
removed to their present habitation, this poor creature was much
perplexed at the loss of the old familiar turns and corners by
which she had been accustomed to feel her way about.&nbsp; The
only way in which they could comfort her, was to bring to her the
Word that &ldquo;endureth for ever,&rdquo; pass her hands over
it, and lift them up to heaven.</p>
<p>It is not unusual to find persons of determined character
holding peculiar sentiments, and very dogmatical in the
expression of them.&nbsp; With significant nods and wise shakes
of the head, you may frequently hear this worthy couple saying,
that &ldquo;man can do nothing towards converting
himself&mdash;no, nothing.&nbsp; You may as well tell me to mount
up to the sky, as that man can think one good thought of himself,
or do one right action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman entertains a very high respect for the excellent
curate we have before mentioned.&nbsp; Once, on detecting herself
speaking more highly of him and his work than was consistent with
her principles of the &ldquo;creature being nothing,&rdquo; she
qualified her praise by saying, &ldquo;He was able to do all
this, because the Lord&rsquo;s time was come; he wouldn&rsquo;t
have done nothing without that, d&rsquo;ye see,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I spoke to her once about some plans of my own, <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>by which I
hoped to effect some improvement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if the Lord&rsquo;s time is
come for it, you&rsquo;ll do it; and if it isn&rsquo;t, you
won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll stop you up, or let you go on,
just as He sees fit.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t trouble so much as some
people do about trying to alter things, and make &rsquo;em
better; for I know the Lord have planned it all out, and
He&rsquo;ll do it just as He likes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although they have the greatest respect for the whole of
God&rsquo;s Word, yet some portions of it are much more
frequently quoted and dwelt upon than others.&nbsp; &ldquo;No man
can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw
him,&rdquo; seems to have made a greater impression than,
&ldquo;Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Divine grace sanctifies the natural disposition, but it does
not entirely alter it; and we can often trace an intimate
connexion between character and creed.&nbsp; The opposition which
these good people had experienced had tended to strengthen a
severity natural to them.&nbsp; How different were these
impressions of truth from those of the kind-hearted man
previously described, who &ldquo;would have all men to be
saved,&rdquo; and could scarcely bring his mind to acquiesce in
any wish short of that.&nbsp; There are few Christians to be met
with who are not more deeply impressed with one form or phase of
truth than another.&nbsp; Nor is this to be regretted, if we can
only meet on the common ground of &ldquo;love to Him who has died
for us.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the words of one of the most popular
preachers of the present day, <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>&ldquo;Supposing the Spirit of truth
to descend upon the earth, would He anywhere find a temple
erected to Himself, of which He could take possession and say,
&lsquo;This is mine?&rsquo;&nbsp; No; but He would go from one
building to another, and see here a <i>stone</i> that He could
claim as His own, and there another, and we should hear Him
saying, &lsquo;The materials for my temple are now scattered,
though most of them are to be found even here; but the day is
coming when I will collect them together, and <i>My temple shall
stand upon the earth</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the sketches of character thus presented, there is no
intention of conveying the idea that the inhabitants of the
Potteries generally answer to this description.&nbsp; The object
has been to shew that, in the midst of every disadvantage, and
surrounded by all incentives to evil, God has had His own people,
and has given them grace to persevere to the end.</p>
<p>To such as have accustomed themselves to look down upon this
place as a plague-spot&mdash;a pest that we should be well rid
of, this narrative will shew that there is good material to be
picked out of the rubbish, and that even the rubbish itself may
be capable of conversion into good material.&nbsp; In talking to
policemen, I have more than once heard them say, &ldquo;We hardly
ever take up any of the Pottery people for theft; they are known
amongst us to be honest and industrious.&nbsp; Our work lies
among the Irish.&nbsp; We have very little to do with the Pottery
people; and if it were not for the <span
class="GutSmall">DRINK</span>, we should have <i>nothing</i> to
do with them.&rdquo;</p>

He is kind to them.&nbsp; Now, we think it would be better for

<p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span><span
class="smcap">Ah</span> this drink, this terrible drink, which
still goes on slaying its thousands and tens of thousands!&nbsp;
No wonder that indignation has been so roused against it, that
many have banished it from their tables, and even from their
houses!&nbsp; Our poor Potteries have endured a full share of the
misery and destruction that ever follow it.</p>
<p>During the summer the brickmaker, with the assistance of the
elder members of his family, sometimes earns between &pound;2 and
&pound;3 per week.&nbsp; One man informed me that he and his
family had earned &pound;2, 18s. nearly every week through the
season; and yet that man&rsquo;s wife and three children were
shivering at my door, one bitterly cold morning in December, and
begging for food and clothing.&nbsp; The effects of the hard work
and hard drinking had been to bring on a terrible illness, and
not a sixpence was left of all the money which they had earned
&ldquo;when the sun was shining.&rdquo;&nbsp; After enduring
privation and suffering too terrible to contemplate, the man and
one of the children died, and the poor widow with the remaining
children went to the workhouse.</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>Were it
not for this inveterate habit of drinking, few places would be
more independent of help from without than the Potteries; but
long habits of intemperance have so impoverished the people, that
few can now afford to <i>buy</i> the pigs for themselves; they
therefore fatten them &ldquo;upon commission,&rdquo; and in this
way can gain only a miserable livelihood.&nbsp; Considerable sums
of money, however, may be still earned by those who are careful
and prudent, both by pig-feeding and brick-making.&nbsp; The
latter work is not constant, but can be procured at only one
particular time of the year.&nbsp; Hence in the course of the
same year may be seen, in the same family, the extreme of
prodigality and destitution.&nbsp; The effect of an increased
income, generally, is that more money goes to the public-house,
and the future is still unprovided for.&nbsp; I have often told
these labourers that their memories seemed much shorter than the
bees&rsquo;, birds&rsquo;, and ants&rsquo;.&nbsp; These little
creatures never forget that winter will return, and make the most
ample provision for it.&nbsp; But any stranger would think that
the present was the first winter which these human beings had
ever known; that it had come upon them unexpectedly, and found
them unprepared for it.</p>
<p>The only means by which many of them get food for the winter
is by pawning the little furniture that they have, or by
&ldquo;going on tick,&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, by getting
trusted at the shops.&nbsp; Those, however, who manage to pay for
their things as they buy them, do it in such a manner as to be
little better off than under <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>the &ldquo;tick&rdquo; system.&nbsp;
The child is sometimes sent to the shop three times a-day, to
obtain the supplies for each meal as it is wanted.&nbsp; Of
course, the shopkeeper cannot give so much time, paper, and
string without being paid for them.&nbsp; After a careful
calculation, I feel convinced that, whether the poor man&rsquo;s
wants are supplied through the &ldquo;tick system,&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;hand-to-mouth&rdquo; system, in either case he gets the
value of only fourteen shillings for his pound.&nbsp; This proves
the justice of the saying, that poverty perpetuates itself.</p>
<p>The winter of 1856&ndash;57 was one of unusual distress.&nbsp;
Less casual work than usual turned up in the neighbourhood; and
had it not been that several of the women found employment as
charwomen and laundresses, many would have had no resource but
the workhouse.</p>
<p>When the mother has to go out to work that she may obtain the
necessary food for herself and children, the effects to the
family are often most disastrous.&nbsp; On her return, wearied
out in earning her hard-won half-crown, she finds that the baby
has been crying for hours (as well it might, poor thing!); that
another child has been scalded by hot water from the kettle; that
another, perhaps, has wandered away, and has not come home, and
that she herself must go and seek for it; while the &ldquo;little
girl&rdquo; left in charge of the whole is severely scolded, if
not beaten, for her many shortcomings.&nbsp; In the midst of all
these annoyances, the father returns for the hundredth time,
without having found work, exhausted <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>and footsore in his fruitless search;
and, sorer still in spirit, as he feels that he is not wanted in
the world, that the labour-market has no demand for him, he
enters the wretched hovel which he is obliged to call
&ldquo;home.&rdquo;&nbsp; He hears the crying of the children,
the scolding of the mother; and sees everywhere the destruction
which children left to themselves will cause.&nbsp; The wife
throws her half-crown at him as he enters, crying, &ldquo;There!
much good may that do yer.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a shilling&rsquo;s
worth of things broke,&mdash;Johnny&rsquo;s coat is burnt, and
Sally&rsquo;s pinafore; the children have eat up the tea out of
the paper; and yer&rsquo;ll have to pay for a sight o&rsquo;
doctoring afore this scalded leg is well.&rdquo;&nbsp; A man
already angry would, with less aggravation than this, return
railing for railing; and so the angry words are given back again
with interest.&nbsp; Blows occasionally follow, according to the
temper of the moment, sometimes inflicted on the provoking wife,
sometimes on the poor victim whose negligence is supposed to have
caused all these misfortunes.&nbsp; The cravings of hunger oblige
some one at last to pick up the half-crown, and &ldquo;the
girl&rdquo; is despatched with many threats to the nearest places
where bread and cheese and porter can be procured, and charged at
the same time to get &ldquo;two penn&rsquo;orth of gin,&rdquo; to
give to the baby to make it sleep.&nbsp; This expensive food
consumes the greater part of the half-crown.&nbsp; Three
pennyworth of bread, two pennyworth of vegetables, two pennyworth
of barley or rice, and four pennyworth of meat <i>well cooked</i>
would have supplied all the family with a good nourishing supper,
<a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>leaving
something for the mid-day meal of the morrow; but there has been
no one at home to cook, and in their excited and miserable state
it is not food they care for, so much as something that will dim
the perception of their extreme wretchedness&mdash;anything that
will make them sleep and forget.&nbsp; So they drink the porter,
and the baby has the gin, and, in spite of the moan of the
scalded child, they sleep; but in such an atmosphere, surrounded
with such dirt within and stench without, that should they all
awake with burning fever the next morning, no one can
wonder.&nbsp; They tell me that, on the mornings after such
nights, they suffer from intense depression, so much so, that
whatever remains of the half-crown is spent on drink, in order to
drag themselves up to a repetition of their daily toil.</p>
<p>Now, the earnings of the family just described (for I have
drawn a picture from real life) averaged for five months in the
summer &pound;2, 10s. per week.&nbsp; They could, of course, have
lived very well upon twenty-five shillings.&nbsp; If we reckon
ten shillings for paying off old scores, buying new clothes,
furniture, and sundries, there would still be fifteen shillings
left, which might have been put into the Savings&rsquo; Bank to
meet the demands of the ensuing winter.&nbsp; But instead of
doing this, the man in his distress confessed to me, that the
cost of what he and his wife drank each week of their prosperity
would amount to at least a pound.&nbsp; The usual quantity of
beer that a brickmaker takes during the hours of work is seven
pints.&nbsp; This expenditure is looked upon simply as necessary:
and when money is <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>plentiful, there must be the drinking for luxury as well
as necessity.</p>
<p>The only excuse which can be made for this recklessness is
that the toil of the brickmaker is excessive.&nbsp; In the
summer, he is expected to work from four or five o&rsquo;clock in
the morning till eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening.&nbsp; This
pressure of work necessitates the drying of sand on Sunday for
the next week&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; The Sabbath is no day of rest
to him.&nbsp; He is expected even on that day, and during his
short night, to be watchful over the bricks, and cover them up on
the approach of rain.&nbsp; Should he oversleep himself, (which
is at least possible after such a day&rsquo;s work,) or be away
at a place of worship on a Sunday, and the bricks in the meantime
be injured by wet, he would lose some part of his wages, of which
a portion is always kept back by the master.</p>
<p>I had a conversation, recently, with a man who has for the
last seven or eight years acted as a kind of leader in a
brick-field.&nbsp; During all this time he has been a
&ldquo;teetotaller;&rdquo; and though his work has been as hard
as that of any man in the field, and sometimes even harder, he is
in perfectly good health, and what is still more unusual, retains
the full possession of his intellectual faculties.&nbsp; I say,
unusual; for in most cases when this hard work is accompanied
with hard drinking, the brickmaker does actually very nearly
realise the old woman&rsquo;s complimentary description of,
&ldquo;He has no more sense than the clay he works
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; His life thus literally resembles that of the
brute: every bone, muscle, and sinew is exerted to its utmost
extent.&nbsp; <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>The only change from work is eating, drinking, and
sleeping; and when this has gone on for several years, all
intellectual power seems extinct.</p>
<p>The man to whom I have just referred has for some years past
rented a house near the Potteries, for which he pays seven
shillings per week.&nbsp; The eldest girl, now fourteen years
old, has been in a place for the last four years, and is so fond
of it, (the father tells me,) that when she comes home for a
holiday, nothing can induce her to stay a minute beyond the time
appointed for her return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a holiday,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;last autumn,
and I took my wife and children to the Crystal Palace.&nbsp; We
had a beautiful day there, and see&rsquo;d enough in that little
time to give us something to talk about ever since.&nbsp; The
only trouble we had was, my girl was in a kind of a fidget, for
fear she shouldn&rsquo;t get back to her place in
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked this man a great many questions about his mode of
life.&nbsp; He said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our trade would do very well, if it wasn&rsquo;t for
the number of hours we have to work, and if we could get our
Sundays to ourselves.&nbsp; There is just now a strike among the
men; they want to get sixpence a thousand more upon the bricks
than they at present receive: and as I know how to reckon very
well, I know that the masters could give us that, and still get a
handsome profit for themselves.&nbsp; If we could get that, then
we should only work from six to six; and we shouldn&rsquo;t, in
that case, have to dry our sand on Sundays; we <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>could then
get all that we wanted ready on Saturday evening.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t hold with these strikes, ma&rsquo;am; they are not
the right sort of thing.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t much use, either,
for men to stand out against their masters; for until they have
learnt to save money, they can&rsquo;t hold out no time hardly
without hurting themselves dreadful.&nbsp; The day the men turned
out, a gentleman was riding by, and he stopped and asked me what
it was all about; and so I told him.&nbsp; He says to me,
&lsquo;Do you take any part in it?&rsquo;&nbsp; And I says,
&lsquo;No, sir, I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable about it at all;
but, sir, for all that I don&rsquo;t like this <i>way</i> of
doing it, I don&rsquo;t think the men are asking for more than
they should; they only want the masters to be as considerate of
them as they are of their horses.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you
mean?&rsquo; the gentleman says.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, sir, I mean
this, that the horse employed in our brick-field is brought in at
six o&rsquo;clock in the morning, he has a proper time for rest
in the day, and he is always taken off again at six in the
evening; but the men must work fifteen and sixteen hours to get a
living out of it; and this hurts their bodies and souls too, sir;
for it isn&rsquo;t many men can think much as works like
that.&nbsp; I am a stronger man than most, sir, and I save myself
a deal by not drinking; but it hurts me, I find, and as soon as I
can get a little money in hand, I shall try and get out of it,
and take to selling coals, or something of that
kind.&rsquo;&nbsp; You know, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; the man
continued, &ldquo;I think over all these things a deal, and I do
wish masters would listen to what we have got to say; for though
we ain&rsquo;t <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>so wise, like, as they are, we think we could make some
things plainer to them.&nbsp; When this was first talked of among
the men, I did wish master would let me talk to him about
it.&nbsp; I think, if he would have heard how we &rsquo;splained
all, things wouldn&rsquo;t have been as they are now.&nbsp; It
seems to me, that God have planned out this world for us all to
depend upon one another, and we ought never to stand to one
another as we do now.&nbsp; You know, ma&rsquo;am, when we
working-men look at all these fine houses and gardens about, and
see all the fine furniture that goes into them, we know that it
is all done by our labour, and that the great people
couldn&rsquo;t do without us, any more than we could do without
them.&nbsp; And it do seem to me, the world would be a deal
happier, and better, too, than it is, if we felt that sort of
thing to one another; felt, I mean, that we were all wanted,
like, to make the world go on right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him, I thought many masters of the present day felt
just what he said, and honoured and valued their servants, and
wished very much that they should have proper time for improving
themselves, and making their own homes comfortable;
&ldquo;but,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you know as well as I do, that
when men <i>get</i> this time, they do not always make a right
use of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s how it is, you see, ma&rsquo;am; and I
am always a-telling &rsquo;em how they do stand in their own way,
and hurt theirselves.&nbsp; Though we can&rsquo;t have everything
we want to get, there is a good many of &rsquo;em needn&rsquo;t
be half so bad off as they are; but you <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>see,
ma&rsquo;am, there is a great deal of bad management at home,
sometimes, and that always keeps a man down.&nbsp; I have looked
after this thing so long, that I can pretty well tell whether a
man has got a good home or not, afore I ask him.&nbsp; He always
holds up his head, and doesn&rsquo;t seem afraid of anybody; and
if things do go cross with him, he does not get reckless, like,
about it, and he takes the world kinder, like, than other
people.&nbsp; I am so thankful to have this nice place to myself
here, and to be able to send my children to school, and see
&rsquo;em growing up the right way, that I never envies
nobody.&nbsp; If master were to offer me his carriage, and to
change places with him, I wouldn&rsquo;t; for I know I&rsquo;m
happy now, and I mightn&rsquo;t be then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked him what he supposed to be the cause why so many
working-men had such wretched homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;there is
so many things, I hardly know what to say.&nbsp; The drink seems
the chief thing; but there is many a man that wouldn&rsquo;t
drink, if he could bear himself without it.&nbsp; There are so
many women who don&rsquo;t seem to know how to manage no more
than nothing; and when <i>they</i> take to drinking and going to
the pawn-shop, then there is nothing but misery for them
all.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s many a woman in our place who has only
one decent gown, and that&rsquo;s most always in the pawn-shop;
she just gets it out of a Saturday night, when the money comes
in, and by Monday sometimes the money is a&rsquo;most gone, and
she puts it in again.&nbsp; Some of our poor fellows have got but
one shirt; and I have known a man give <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>it to his wife on Monday morning to
wash, and she has taken it off to the pawn-shop, and got some
drink with the money she got.&nbsp; Sometimes when the wife does
try to go on right, the man don&rsquo;t; he takes to all the bad
ways, and leads her a dog&rsquo;s life: it is only when they both
pull one way that it all goes right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the distress of the winter, to which I have before
referred, I thought it a good time to endeavour to make some
impression upon them as to the urgent necessity of making
provision for the future, so that there might not be a constant
repetition of such terrible calamities.&nbsp; I therefore
addressed the following letter to them, and sent a copy to each
man in the Potteries:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;TO THE
WORKING-MEN<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE</span><br />
KENSINGTON POTTERIES.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Friends</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen with much concern and sorrow, during the
past winter, how greatly most of you have suffered.&nbsp; Work
has been unusually scarce and difficult to obtain, and you have
found it almost impossible to maintain your families in any
degree of comfort.&nbsp; Perhaps you have been tempted sometimes
to look with envy on your richer neighbours, and have thought
that they cared nothing for all your sorrow and suffering; but,
indeed, many of them have cared a great deal about it, and have
talked over it, and <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>have tried to think of some means to prevent this sad
state of things from happening so often.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of you think, I dare say, that rich people should
help you, by giving you more of their money; and so they should,
perhaps, in times of sickness and calamity: but I have watched
these things now for many years, and I have not observed that
those do best who have most given to them; but the prosperous
people are generally those who resolutely set about to help
themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, we have been thinking over various ways by which
you could do this better than you have hitherto done; and one
thing that has occurred to us is, that as many of you earn more
money in the summer than you actually need to spend, it would be
a good plan to put by some of it for your use during the
winter.&nbsp; We all find it very difficult to take care of our
money ourselves, and most of us have recourse to some bank or
other to take care of it for us.&nbsp; It is much to be regretted
that there is no Savings&rsquo; Bank in this neighbourhood nearer
than Kensington, and it would take up too much of your time to
carry your money there often.&nbsp; The excellent Penny
Savings&rsquo; Bank established at the Notting Dale School-room
is most valuable, but it at present confines itself to rather
small sums of money; and some of you&mdash;young men especially,
who have not yet begun the expense of housekeeping&mdash;could,
with good management, save a considerable sum of money every
week.&nbsp; If young men only knew what future misery,
degradation, and <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>sorrow they would save themselves by being determined
not to involve themselves in the expense of a family until they
had at least fifty pounds in the Savings&rsquo; Bank, I am sure
they would try hard for it</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would give me much pleasure to do something to help
you over this difficulty; and if you do not object to trust me
with your money, I propose being at the Infant School-room,
Princes&rsquo; Place, every Saturday evening, from eight till
nine o&rsquo;clock, to receive from you any sum you may have to
spare from your weekly earnings.&nbsp; You would have a little
book in which to keep your own account, which you could at any
time compare with mine.&nbsp; One of your kind friends in this
neighbourhood, Mr &mdash;, has kindly consented to take care of
the money.&nbsp; By giving a week&rsquo;s notice, you can have
out what you put in, at any time you like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can tell you of one way that would enable you
to save a good deal of money.&nbsp; There are thousands of
workmen in this country who are doing some of the hardest work
that is ever done, such as working at iron-foundries, &amp;c.,
and who do it all without the aid of intoxicating drink.&nbsp;
With the money thus saved they are able to get better food,
better clothing, and more comfortable homes; and, consequently,
are better, stronger, and happier.&nbsp; I wish very much that
you would give this a trial.&nbsp; At the end of the week, you
can reckon how much you usually spend upon drink, and can bring
that sum to me.&nbsp; I am sure you would feel the benefit of it
in <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>the
winter.&nbsp; I have the pleasure of meeting some of your wives
every week, and then we talk a great deal about the best means of
making your homes comfortable; but the wife cannot do it all
alone: it is her place to learn to lay out the money to the best
possible advantage,&mdash;it is yours to obtain it; and it is
when both husband and wife act wisely and well, that the family
is usually prosperous and happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But above all these things I have mentioned, I want you
to be in earnest in seeking to obtain God&rsquo;s blessing upon
all you do.&nbsp; &lsquo;Seek first the kingdom of God and his
righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Perhaps you think you should like to have the
good things promised without the trouble of seeking God; but
those who have tried, those who have really sought God, and found
Him, tell us that this is the best part of it, and that they
would rather give up every earthly possession than live again
without God in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, when Jesus came from heaven, He did not
settle Himself in a grand house, and have a number of people to
wait upon Him; but He, as the reputed son of a carpenter, worked
as you do for the supply of His own wants, and spent a great deal
of time, besides, in helping those who wanted help.&nbsp; However
poor or neglected you may be, you cannot be more so than Jesus
was.&nbsp; I do not know of anything so likely to cheer you in
your daily toil, as to remember that God cares for you; that He
is watching you, and inviting you to come to Him, weary and <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>heavy laden
as you are, and He will give you rest.&nbsp; I wish you would
come to this kind Friend every day, and ask Him to make you wise
to know how to manage your worldly affairs aright; and ask Him to
make you holy, that your worst enemy, sin, may not triumph over
you.&nbsp; Ask Him to make you fit for that &lsquo;beautiful
world He has gone to prepare;&rsquo; so that when you have
accomplished, as an hireling, your day, and finished the work He
has given you to do, you may find an entrance into that kingdom,
which is not meat and drink, &lsquo;but righteousness, and peace,
and joy in the Holy Ghost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to meet many of you at the Infant Schoolroom,
Princes&rsquo; Place, on Saturday, the 1st of May.&nbsp; I intend
to be there about a quarter before eight o&rsquo;clock; and if I
can help you in this or in any other way, it will give me much
pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;I am,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Your sincere
friend.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It did not surprise me at all, that for some weeks this letter
seemed to be taken no notice of.&nbsp; I went regularly to the
place appointed, but no one came.&nbsp; Among other reasons, no
doubt the calamities of the past winter had involved in debt
nearly all of those to whom I had written, and the money for the
first few months after they obtained work went to pay off old
scores.&nbsp; But the principal obstacle was, that where people
have been so little accustomed to think and reason, any new
proposition would, in the first place, <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>take some time to be comprehended;
and then, as the safety of their money was involved in the plan,
it would require to be received with great caution.&nbsp; When a
month had passed, a few began to bring me small sums.&nbsp; I had
no large depositors during the summer, and the whole of my
receipts did not amount to more than &pound;25.&nbsp; This,
however, was a beginning; and as the men received their money
back again in the winter, several of them remarked that it was
&ldquo;all as if it was given them; the bits of money would all
have been gone, if they had not been saved up in this
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found that a few of them had previously made some attempts
at saving money, and were much disappointed at the result.&nbsp;
One woman told me she had once with great difficulty managed to
save up seven pounds; one day, when she was absent, her little
room was broken into, and all the money stolen.&nbsp; They said
they were too far off either from Kensington or Paddington
Savings&rsquo; Bank to deposit their money there; and &ldquo;as
to keeping it in their own places, that was
impossible,&mdash;<i>it never kept there</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A ragged boy, about thirteen years of age, came to the
school-room one evening, bringing a penny which he asked me to
keep for him; and said, if I would come for it, he would bring a
penny there every evening.&nbsp; I told him I had not time to do
that; but if he would take care of it through the week, I should
be glad to receive sevenpence from him every Monday
evening.&nbsp; He said he couldn&rsquo;t do that; for if he had
it in his <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>pocket, he should play pitch and toss with it.&nbsp; I
told him, if he would bring it in the dinner-hour, the Infant
School teacher would be so kind as to take care of it for him
till the night came for paying it in.&nbsp; This he agreed to
do.&nbsp; I asked him how it was he had just the penny every day
to save.&nbsp; He said he was earning ninepence a-day then; and
that he told his mother he earned only eightpence, and so saved a
penny for himself.&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t do it
in that way.&nbsp; I dare say, if you told your mother you wanted
to save a penny a-day, she would not object to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell my mother, indeed!&rdquo; said the boy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh yes! and take her a stick at the same time to beat me
with; and then it would be the sooner over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then asked me what I meant to do with all the money he
brought me, or rather meant to bring me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall put it in my desk, and take care of it till you
want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But supposing now I should die, what would you do with
it then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have not thought of that.&nbsp; I hope you will
live, and make a good use of the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose I don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when you have saved two or three shillings, you
can make your will, if you like, and leave it to
somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t write, and I&rsquo;ve heard as how
wills is &lsquo;allus writed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you had better come to the Ragged School, as soon
as it is opened, and learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>&ldquo;Well, I think I will.&nbsp; I have heard it takes
a sight o&rsquo; money to bury anybody.&nbsp; If I should die
afore I can write, you can spend the money for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; but I hope you will live and learn to read
and write, and grow up to be a clever and good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do yer now?&rdquo; said he, walking off with one of
those inimitable whistles peculiar to ragged boys.</p>

<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>A <span
class="GutSmall">LITTLE</span> before Christmas I received an
intimation through the women whom I used to meet, that their
husbands would be glad to talk with me, if I would give them an
opportunity for that purpose.&nbsp; I fixed an evening, and
sixteen men came.&nbsp; They told me they had been thinking a
great deal about the bad management of their affairs generally,
and especially about their habit of buying everything at a great
disadvantage; that they wished very much they could see their way
to do better.&nbsp; One man had a copy of the rules of a Loan
Society which had worked very well in other places, and might be
a great help to them.&nbsp; They would require assistance from
some of the gentlemen of the neighbourhood to help them to start
it.&nbsp; This they asked me to obtain for them, and also the use
of the school-room, where they might make their payments; since,
if they had to go to a public-house for this purpose, they might
as well abandon all thought of saving.&nbsp; Two or three of the
men told me they wanted, in some quiet way, to learn to read and
write better; for though, when they were asked, they said they
could do both, yet they could do <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>neither well enough for the
occupation to be pleasant to them.&nbsp; I knew what they meant
by the &ldquo;quiet way:&rdquo; men have a great dislike to
learning as children, or with children.&nbsp; I told them, as to
the writing, the best thing they could do would be to save a few
sixpences, and buy some of Darnell&rsquo;s copy-books.&nbsp; Any
man might teach himself to write well from them, with no other
assistance than just being told how to hold his pen.&nbsp; Good
reading, too, they might acquire by constant practice and
listening to others who could read better than they.</p>
<p>This last observation opened the way for me to introduce
another subject.&nbsp; I told them that, before we separated, I
wished to read a chapter in the Bible.&nbsp; Though we differed
in many other respects, we were all alike in this, that each
needed God&rsquo;s teaching; and if we expected any of our plans
for improving our condition in life to be successful, we must ask
God&rsquo;s guidance in making the plans, and His blessing in
carrying them out.&nbsp; One of the men immediately got up and
brought me a Bible, adding, &ldquo;Now we shall be all
right.&rdquo;&nbsp; This man was a great professor of religion,
but I knew, alas! not always a consistent one; and I saw the
scornful curl of the lip directed against him from some of his
comrades.&nbsp; Out of these sixteen men a great variety of
creeds might have been collected.&nbsp; One or two of my
listeners were stanch Baptists; about the same number were
Wesleyans; one, I believe, was in the habit of attending the
Church: but those who had hitherto taken the leading part in the
conversation <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>were men who have always a great deal to say against
&ldquo;parsons;&rdquo; who use the word &ldquo;humbug&rdquo; more
frequently than any other in reference to anything of a religious
nature.&nbsp; Most of the rest belonged to a very numerous class;
more numerous among working-men than is generally supposed.&nbsp;
They might be styled Gallios; for they professedly, at least,
&ldquo;cared for none of these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt the difficulty of suiting such an audience, and as I
turned over the pages of the book, had to encourage myself by the
thought, &ldquo;Never mind; it is God&rsquo;s Word, and not
yours.&rdquo;&nbsp; I began by saying that amongst the many
different characters who came to Jesus, when He was upon earth,
there was one in particular, mentioned in the 3d chapter of St
John, whose history would interest us.&nbsp; He differed from
others in this respect, that he was not a poor man.&nbsp; He was
a Ruler among the Jews,&mdash;a master of Israel; but that did
not much signify, since we need in our smaller affairs the same
wisdom that he was seeking to enable him to be a better
Ruler.</p>
<p>Now, though this man wished to be wiser and better, he thought
it would never do for the people, who looked up to him as their
Ruler and Guide, to see him going to Jesus to be taught just like
any common man; so at last he thought of the plan of seeing Jesus
by night.&nbsp; In this way, he hoped he should get what he
wanted, without making his visit known to other people.&nbsp;
Many teachers would have said, &ldquo;Well, as you are ashamed to
be <i>seen</i> coming to me, you <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>had better not come at
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Jesus did not think of the affront put upon
Himself; He only saw before Him a man whose heart was not right
with God, who was not safe for heaven.&nbsp; I dare say, too,
that as Jesus knew all that was passing in the mind of this
Ruler, He knew that he had not come to Him for heavenly knowledge
only.&nbsp; He rather perhaps wished to learn from Jesus some
arts of government, by which he could obtain a greater influence
over the people.&nbsp; He would have liked to have known how long
the Jews were to be in subjection to the Romans, and many other
things of that kind.&nbsp; But Jesus had made this man&rsquo;s
soul, and knew its worth; knew it as a fact that it must live for
ever, and that, if He helped him now to gain or to govern the
whole world, it would be of some little use to him for a few
prosperous years, and then would come the blackness of darkness
for ever.&nbsp; Therefore, without taking any notice of
Nicodemus&rsquo;s compliments, whatever they may have meant, He
lost not a moment in announcing to His wondering disciple the
great and solemn truth, &ldquo;Ye must be born again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After explaining this to them as well as I could, together
with a few of the following verses, we came to the
words,&mdash;&ldquo;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
turned to the chapter in Numbers, giving the account of
this.&nbsp; From the intense interest with which these men
listened to this simply as a narrative, I was led to suppose that
to some of them it <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>might be new.&nbsp; I told them I once saw a picture of
this extraordinary story.&nbsp; In one corner of the picture was
the pole with the serpent lifted upon it.&nbsp; Strong men,
women, and little children were there; some in great agony, as if
just bitten; others perfectly prostrate, with the hue of death
upon their faces.&nbsp; Mothers were standing with little
children in their arms, trying to raise the head that seemed to
have drooped in death, and to rouse it just for one look.&nbsp;
But that which struck me most was the figure of a man standing
before an apparently dying woman.&nbsp; He had something in his
hand, to which he endeavoured to draw her attention; and his
figure was placed exactly between her and the brazen serpent, so
that without stretching her head either to the one side or the
other, she could not see the object from which alone she was to
derive life.&nbsp; The artist had made it appear that, with the
little dying strength which remained, she was trying to move
herself out of the way of this hindrance; and as I continued to
look at the picture, so strongly was I impressed, that I felt
myself saying, &ldquo;This man <i>must</i> be got out of the way,
or she will die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In thinking over this afterwards,&rdquo; I continued,
&ldquo;it occurred to me that there were many <i>now</i> acting
the part of this cruel man.&nbsp; All teachers of error resemble
him.&nbsp; Those lecturers, whom some of you men hear
occasionally, and who tell you to believe in nothing you cannot
see,&mdash;that as to your being bitten with the old serpent,
<i>sin</i>, it is all a fiction, although, even whilst you are
listening, you can hardly be still for the agony <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>which the
bites have inflicted; the Roman Catholic priest, too, who comes
and tells us we need not <i>look for ourselves</i>, that his
looking for us, or the intercession of the Virgin Mary, will do
equally well&mdash;that at any rate we need not trouble
<i>ourselves</i>,&mdash;are like this man in the picture.&nbsp;
Then you yourselves sometimes stand in one another&rsquo;s way;
and when you see any eye directed aright, instead of removing all
impediments, you rather, by your jesting, ridicule, and banter,
cause the eye to be turned away.&nbsp; And what is it turned
to?&nbsp; It just goes back to the old dreary state of
&lsquo;seeking rest, and finding none.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nothing ever
strikes me so much in false teaching as its cruelty.&nbsp; These
self-constituted leaders will see you suffer without relief,
knowing, too, that bad as it is, this is only the beginning of
suffering, they will still interpose themselves and their false
doctrines between you and the look that would bring such healing
and joy as you have never known before.&nbsp; It is something
like this:&mdash;Suppose there was but one large fountain of
water in the street from which the inhabitants could obtain their
supplies, and that this fountain was in the keeping of one
person, whose duty it was to open it to all who applied, and to
allow them to help themselves as freely as they pleased; suppose,
then, that instead of aiding you to fill your pitcher, he
exercised a great deal of ingenuity in persuading you that if you
carried it to the top of Notting Hill, or over to Kensington,
perhaps you would get water which would answer your purpose much
better&mdash;that the wells there had been more recently
dug&mdash;that the <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>water there would suit your particular constitution
better; that he said anything, rather than allow you to supply
your wants in the most simple and direct way&mdash;in the way
intended and provided by one who really did know exactly what was
adapted for you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be sorry to undertake to persuade any of you
to go this round-about way to supply your wants.&nbsp; Your own
good sense would be stronger than any arguments I could possibly
use.&nbsp; You would say, &lsquo;It has answered the purpose for
years past, and those who have gone before us have done very well
upon it; why should I change?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever your worldly interests are concerned, I do not
consider you men are easily to be taken in; it is only about the
salvation of your souls&mdash;your eternal interests&mdash;that
which will be living on still when the heavens and the earth have
passed away,&mdash;it is only on these points that you allow
yourselves to be&mdash;to be&mdash;I must use one of your own
words&mdash;to be &lsquo;humbugged.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, again, if it were some difficult thing which God
asked us to do, we might make many excuses&mdash;we might plead
the want of learning, the want of capacity, the want of strength;
but we have only to &lsquo;Look, and live.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said one of the men, &ldquo;will
you pray for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all kneeled together, and prayed that whatever prevented
our looking to the &ldquo;Crucified One&rdquo; might be removed;
and that, instead of going to earthly fountains to quench our
thirst, we might drink of the water of everlasting life, and
thirst no more.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>Just as
we were separating, one of the men said&mdash;&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am,
if you will come here to meet us every Wednesday evening,
we&rsquo;ll all come, and bring about a hundred more with
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied that I was much obliged to them, but I
really had not the time to spare.&nbsp; If my help was the only
help they could get, I would make any sacrifice and come; but if
they would only take the trouble to walk about half a mile, to Mr
Lewis&rsquo;s school-room, at Westbourne Grove, he would be very
glad to see them in their working clothes, and would explain
everything to them much better than I could.</p>
<p>Several of them promised to go; and as most of them were still
lingering about over the fire, I said to them,&mdash;&ldquo;I
wish you men, would try and get out of the way of talking about
&lsquo;parsons&rsquo; as you do.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean to say
that all &lsquo;parsons&rsquo; are what they ought to be by a
great deal; but the way you often speak of them is as unjust as
it would be for me to speak with contempt of all working-men,
because some amongst them are drunkards and thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said one of them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fair play&rsquo;s a jewel, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not only the unfairness to them,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;but you put yourselves very often out of the way of
receiving benefit from those who do most sincerely and earnestly
wish to help you.&nbsp; As long as we dislike people, it is
hardly possible that they can do us any good.&nbsp; If you are
not in a hurry to go, I will tell you about a man I met with
lately, who was doing himself a great deal of mischief in this
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>They
said they were in no hurry,&mdash;they shouldn&rsquo;t do
anything more that night; they were glad to stay.</p>
<p>(I did not give them the story so fully as I have written it
here.&nbsp; I had no notes with me; and simply told them from
memory the part that would apply to our previous
conversation.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some weeks before we went into the house in which
we now live, several workmen were employed there; and I generally
went once in the course of the day, to see how they were getting
on.&nbsp; One of them, a painter, was a remarkably clever man; he
seemed to have read an endless number of books, papers, and
everything else.&nbsp; It was the time of the Indian mutiny; and
if I had been unable to look at the papers, he could always tell
me anything that was going on.&nbsp; He often made remarks upon
the government of the country, and sometimes these were very
sensible.&nbsp; As he was a single man, and did not seem to care
much where he spent his time, I proposed to him that (as he had
to come all the way from Blackfriars) he should take possession
of a little bed-room in the house, and make himself comfortable
there.&nbsp; He seemed very glad to do this.&nbsp; A day or two
after he had settled himself, I had occasion to go to his room;
and I found, amongst other things, a great quantity of books and
newspapers strewed about.&nbsp; Some of the books were political,
some on India; and there were a few novels, by no means the
best.&nbsp; After I had finished speaking to him about his work
that day, I said to him, &lsquo;When I was up in your room just
now, I was looking at your books.&nbsp; <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Some of them
are very good.&nbsp; I am going to ask you to be so kind as to
lend me one for a few days, it is &ldquo;Napier&rsquo;s
India.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; He seemed much pleased, and ran off
directly to fetch it.&nbsp; When he returned, I said,
&lsquo;There was one thought that came into my mind while I was
looking at your books.&nbsp; If I had not known whose they really
were, I should have supposed that they belonged to some one who
had no interest in anything beyond the present life; some one who
meant to get as cleverly as possible through that;&mdash;but that
was all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose you mean, ma&rsquo;am, there were no
religious books there?&nbsp; As to those, I gave all them up long
ago: I couldn&rsquo;t stand such twaddle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you had a great experience of religious
books?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, no.&nbsp; I went to a Sunday-school once,
but it wasn&rsquo;t much of it; and some ladies used to call and
leave us some tracts, and beg us to read them.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t like to promise to do so, and not do it; but it was
such &ldquo;bosh!&rdquo;&nbsp; Do you know, ma&rsquo;am, after
you had been here for a day or two, we were talking about you;
and I said, &ldquo;I do think she is one of the right sort; she
doesn&rsquo;t bring us any tracts, or any
twaddle.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am afraid I am going to lose my good
character.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh no, ma&rsquo;am; I shall be happy to listen
to anything you have to say!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I want to hear what <i>you</i> have to
say.&nbsp; It <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>interests me very much to know how you are planning it
out.&nbsp; Do you intend to make the best of this life; and
then&mdash;<i>what</i> then?&nbsp; Are you so pleased with it, as
to feel satisfied that all shall end here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, as to being pleased with it, I don&rsquo;t
think anybody who has lived five-and-twenty years in the world
can be much pleased with it.&nbsp; I am sure it ain&rsquo;t much
to me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve nobody, hardly, belonging to me, to care
anything about me; and if it wasn&rsquo;t for the liking I have
for books, and that sort of thing, I should have nothing but my
work to do, and to eat, and drink, and sleep: and I don&rsquo;t
call that worth living for; do you, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, indeed, I do not.&nbsp; I feel very sorry
for you.&nbsp; I should so like to help you to be happier, if I
only knew how; but, perhaps, if I told you what I think about it,
you might call it &ldquo;bosh&rdquo; or &ldquo;twaddle,&rdquo; or
something of that sort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, I shouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You
see, ma&rsquo;am, it isn&rsquo;t because I haven&rsquo;t thought
about these things, for I thought myself almost crazy once; and
the people who, I expected, might have helped me were worse to me
than anybody.&nbsp; My father was a mighty religious man in his
way, and dreadful strict: we couldn&rsquo;t hardly speak or look
of a Sunday, but we got a thrashing for it.&nbsp; My brother and
I have said often and often, that, as soon as we took to the
world for ourselves, we&rsquo;d have done with all that sort of
thing; we had had enough of it.&nbsp; The masters I have worked
for have made a great fuss, some of &rsquo;em, about their <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>own religion;
but they haven&rsquo;t minded cheating us a bit when they could
do it in a quiet way.&nbsp; And as to caring about <i>our</i>
souls, they have never troubled themselves about that.&nbsp; And
don&rsquo;t you think, ma&rsquo;am, that if they really thought
we were going to burn in hell-fire for ever, if we went on a bad
way, that they&rsquo;d make some fuss about it, and try to stop
us?&nbsp; I know, if I believed it, I wouldn&rsquo;t do much
besides try to prevent people going there; but you may depend
upon it, ma&rsquo;am, they don&rsquo;t believe it; they keep it
in store, like, as something to frighten poor ignorant people
with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But I want to know what <i>you</i> think; I am
not just now concerning myself about these people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I have pretty well made up my mind, after
all I have seen, just to take the world as it comes, and live on
in the best way I can, and not trouble my head any more about
it.&nbsp; I suppose, God has got it all planned out about us, and
He&rsquo;ll do what He likes with us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is quite true.&nbsp; God has planned it all
out; but then He has made no secret of His plans.&nbsp; He has
written a book to tell us how we stand towards Him, and how He
stands towards us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! you mean the Bible.&nbsp; We used to be
punished with having to learn chapters out of it, and we hated
it; and I have never took up with it since.&nbsp; People talk
about its being good news, and all that sort of thing; but I
don&rsquo;t believe there is any good news in it for
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Supposing, when you first came here, I had
written a letter to you, inviting you to come to my house
whenever you liked to do so; telling you that I would have a nice
room prepared for you, and, in every respect, would make you as
comfortable as possible; and supposing that, instead of reading
my invitation, and availing yourself of my kind offers, you had
treated my letter with contempt, and refused even to open it,
pleading as an excuse that a letter once proved disagreeable to
you.&nbsp; If, after you left, I should hear that you spread an
evil report about me, and accused me of unkindness, do you not
think I could justly charge you with injustice?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes; and I see what you mean.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve tried to find out much about the Book,
either good or bad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is another thing.&nbsp; I think that you
have rather confused ideas about the character of God.&nbsp; You
confound your earthly with your heavenly Father; and thus you
think unjustly of Him, and His works also.&nbsp; Now, as I cannot
stay longer to-day, I am going to ask you to reward me for not
troubling you with tracts, and what you call
&ldquo;twaddle,&rdquo; by just reading one little chapter that I
will leave turned down for you here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left him the 15th chapter of Luke to read; and he
faithfully read it, and the next day we talked about it.&nbsp; He
was too intellectual a man not to appreciate its exceeding
beauty; but he did not feel himself to be a prodigal needing the
love and forgiveness of the kind <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>Father; so that it was to him little
else than a &lsquo;pleasant song.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After many observations had passed, I asked if he were
in the habit of attending any place of worship.&nbsp; He
answered, &lsquo;Oh, no!&nbsp; I have been to the cathedral
sometimes, but I didn&rsquo;t like it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was Saturday.&nbsp; At the end of our
conversation, I told him I thought he had better make one more
trial of attending a place of worship; and, as he lived in
Blackfriars, I recommended him to go to Surrey Chapel, to hear
the Rev. Newman Hall.&nbsp; He promised he would.&nbsp; On
Monday, I did not get to the house till it was late.&nbsp; Some
of the men had gone away; but this painter was still lingering
over his work.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;I am glad you have come.&nbsp; I wanted to see you, to
tell you I went yesterday to hear the gentleman you spoke
about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am glad to hear it.&nbsp; I hope you will
often go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe I shall, for <i>he</i> is something
about a parson.&nbsp; I said to myself, &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t a
humbug, anyhow.&rdquo;&nbsp; I went in the morning, and I went
again in the evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no time to talk to him then, nor for some days
after.&nbsp; I think the Friday of that week was set apart as a
fast-day.&nbsp; On the Thursday I found him painting away very
busily.&nbsp; As soon as he saw me, he said, &lsquo;We have just
been talking about you, ma&rsquo;am, and we know you are in a
hurry to get this house done; and so, instead of knocking off
work, because it is the fast-day to-morrow, we are going to stick
to our painting, and have a jolly good day at it.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am very much obliged to you; indeed, I
think you are <i>all</i> very kind in trying to accommodate me;
and I quite appreciate all you do; but I could not think of
allowing you to do what you propose.&nbsp; You know the state the
country is in; what terrible accounts we are constantly receiving
from India; and what severe general distress there is.&nbsp;
Although we may not be suffering from these calamities, it would
be selfish and heartless in the extreme not to join with those
who are, in praying for God&rsquo;s mercy to deliver us out of
these troubles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, that&rsquo;s all very right,
I dare say; and I don&rsquo;t object to the thing itself; but
what I object to is the way it is done in.&nbsp; I was reading
the proclamation outside the Mansion House, the other day; and it
says that the Queen <i>commands</i> us all on that day to pray to
Almighty God.&nbsp; Now, I don&rsquo;t think any one has a right
to command us to do anything of the sort; and, if I pray at all,
I shall do it some other day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I gave you credit for being a wiser man.&nbsp;
What would become of law and order in this country, if some one
had not the power to decide such things?&nbsp; There would be no
end of contest and confusion.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose that
either you or I should make very good Sovereigns; but if there
were no one else, it would be much better for the country to give
one of us the power of saying what should or should not be done,
rather than to leave every question open to be contested.&nbsp;
And as to your taking offence at the <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>expression, &ldquo;her Majesty
commands,&rdquo; that is merely a form of words, meaning that her
Majesty confirms the wish of the nation.&nbsp; The term itself is
just as much of a form as the &ldquo;Most Gracious Majesty&rdquo;
which is used to the really gracious and ungracious
alike.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another man then joined in, and said that he thought,
&lsquo;what the nation wanted more than fast-days was better
government.&nbsp; The government was always getting the country
into trouble, and then setting it to pray itself out of it
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If that is the case, that would be a very good
reason in itself for having a fast-day,&rsquo; I said,
&lsquo;that we might pray for better government.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of the men joined in this talk about
governments.&nbsp; It was evidently a topic upon which they were
much in the habit of conversing; and I could not but be struck
with the shrewdness of their observations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last I said, &lsquo;Now, after all you have told me
about oppressive governments, bad laws, taxation, and all that,
you have not brought forward one thing that would for a moment
stand in the way of your following any occupation you like, and
becoming great in it, choosing any kind of home your industry and
resources would enable you to command, reading what books you
like, adopting what form of religious worship you like, sending
your children to any school you like, and taking up with any
friends you like; so that I cannot offer you much sympathy for
the oppressions of which you are complaining.&nbsp; But there <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>is something
going on in this country that is oppressing you.&nbsp; I think,
if you could prove there was anything in the present government
which caused destruction of life and property to 10,000 persons
every year, it would excite such indignation in the country that
the government would hardly stand another week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I should think not,&rsquo; one of them said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And yet there is something going on amongst us
that is destroying at least 60,000 precious souls and bodies
every year; and I have often wondered that you men, who have such
ability to detect and expose the faults of a government, which,
after all, is not hurting you much, and which you cannot alter,
should expend uselessly the power that might be successfully
directed against the monster evil to which I am
referring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You mean the drink, I suppose,
ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Now, here is an evil worth fighting
against.&nbsp; If you directed all your efforts against
<i>this</i> tyrannical government, and were determined to get rid
of it, you would be doing much more good for yourselves, and the
country too, than any House of Commons will ever do, even
supposing all the members of it were elected by
ballot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then followed a kind of teetotal discussion.&nbsp;
Amongst other arguments brought against teetotalism, the painter
objected that &lsquo;people who lived altogether upon food ate
such a lot that they got heavy and stupid in their
minds.&rsquo;&nbsp; I asked him if he knew that the preacher he
had heard last Sunday was a water-drinker?</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear me, no; I never could have thought
it.&nbsp; What! he only drink water?&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s a
good un!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d drink water, too, if I thought I could
get such a headpiece as his out of it.&nbsp; I said to myself, on
Sunday, when I was hearing him, &ldquo;Now, you are a right sort
of a man; if I could be like you, I shouldn&rsquo;t get tired of
being alive, as I do now sometimes.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, indeed; if you were like him, you would not
get tired of living, nor be afraid of dying, either.&nbsp; Now,
suppose you set up from this day to try to be like him.&nbsp; You
know that his nature is no better than yours.&nbsp; God has made
him what he is; and is ready to do everything for you that He has
done for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I think, as we are not to work here
to-morrow, I shall go and hear what he has to say about things;
for perhaps he&rsquo;ll preach a sermon about the country, or
something of that sort.&nbsp; I have been wondering, this week,
how <i>he</i> thinks about what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; I have
thought of a lot of things I should like to ask him
about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He not only went himself to Surrey Chapel, but took
some of his comrades; and many of their future discussions were
grounded upon what they there heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw this man once more, about a month after the house
was finished.&nbsp; He told me, he went every Sunday to hear Mr
Hall; and &lsquo;ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;I do
believe I am beginning to see some things very different from
what I did.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>We separated that evening with the pleasant feeling that we
had become better acquainted, and had <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>found more subjects of common
interest than we had expected.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Exception may be taken, and with apparent justice, that I have
made no effort to disabuse the mind of this man of its many
prejudices and antipathies.&nbsp; Formerly, when I was not so
well acquainted with the habits of thought and feeling among
working-men as I now am, I used to expend considerable time and
trouble in endeavouring to remove their prejudices; but it never
appeared to me that I effected any real good in this way.&nbsp;
The men were usually so far beyond me in acuteness and capacity
to detect and expose what they considered inconsistencies, that
if I succeeded in clearing one victim from imputation, another
was readily substituted.&nbsp; I have, therefore, come to the
conclusion that it is better from the first to treat it as
something altogether irrelevant, and not worthy of notice.&nbsp;
Instead of wasting precious time, and losing opportunities that
may never again present themselves, in arguing about the right
and the wrong of other people, I usually meet such attacks in
this way:&mdash;&ldquo;Supposing these people are as bad as you
say, I cannot see that their faults can make any difference to
you, beyond inducing you to be more careful that you yourself
entirely abstain from what you seem so to dislike in
others.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s law is, &lsquo;So then, every one of us
must give an account of himself to God.&rsquo;&nbsp; He has
written a perfect law that we may study it, and seek to conform
ourselves to it; and to prevent the <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>possibility of our erring through
the want of living example, He has Himself, in the person of
Jesus Christ, lived our earthly life to teach us how to
live.&nbsp; Your making your own conduct depend so much upon what
other people do, is like the folly of a man who would shut the
shutters of his room, excluding all daylight, and then complain
that the dim, flickering, uncertain light of the rushlight he had
substituted, was insufficient to enable him to do his work
properly.&nbsp; If this man, when taking home his work, were to
excuse himself to the master for its being so badly done, on the
ground that the light of his rushlight was insufficient and
uncertain, the master would reply, I never intended you to work
by that light; it is none of my providing.&nbsp; You wilfully
shut out the glorious sun set up for your use in the heavens, and
which I knew would be more than sufficient for every
purpose.&nbsp; Whilst you were groping about almost in the dark,
it was even then surrounding you, waiting only to be permitted to
enter.&nbsp; The blame of this bad work, therefore, returns upon
you, and upon you only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will often happen at a later period of intimacy with such
characters as the one previously described, and when a more
reasonable state of mind has taken the place of harsher feelings,
that the subject of these antipathies can be renewed with
advantage.&nbsp; I remember, in the case of this man, one of the
last conversations I had with him was in reference to remarks he
had been making about some distinguished person whose conduct to
him appeared inconsistent.&nbsp; I said <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>to him,
&ldquo;A few days ago, I had to insist upon one of my children
doing something she did not like to do.&nbsp; A short time
afterwards, I happened to hear her saying to herself, &lsquo;When
I am grown up to be a mamma, I shall not do as my mamma does, I
shall do a great deal better, and let my children do every thing
they like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had been by, you would probably have said,
&lsquo;When you are a mamma you will alter your opinion on that
subject.&rsquo;&nbsp; You would not, probably, by this remark, do
much to remove the impression from the mind of the child that she
was right and I was wrong; but you would be satisfied that
experience would justify you in what you had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe we often resemble this child in the estimate
we form of people who are moving in an entirely different sphere
from our own.&nbsp; I have no doubt, if you could for one week
occupy the palaces and take upon yourself the responsibilities of
these people against whom you have so much to say, as great a
transition would take place in your mind respecting them, as
there will probably be in the mind of this child if she ever
assumes the duties she now supposes are so badly performed; and
your wonder would rather be that, amidst the trials, temptations,
and heavy responsibilities attached to their exalted position,
you had not been able to detect even more apparent
inconsistencies of conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; the man replied, &ldquo;I see
what you mean, and I will think it over, for I have begun to see
lately that I am not always so overright myself.&nbsp; But, <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t think this ill judging that
you complain of is all on one side.&nbsp; If we poor men do make
the mistake of judging the rich too harshly, I am sure the rich
don&rsquo;t forget to &lsquo;pay us back in our own
coin.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid there is much truth in what you say.&nbsp;
This want of consideration for one another is a general evil that
pervades all society and is at the present time causing a great
deal of unhappiness in this country.&nbsp; I have no doubt you
have had masters whose conduct towards you seemed to be entirely
influenced by the amount of work they could get out of you; but
whilst you could justly charge them with this, must you not at
the same time have pleaded guilty if you had been accused of
entertaining much the same sentiment towards them?&nbsp; It is
not because one man is rich and another poor that there is so
little kindly feeling between the two classes, neither is it
altogether that one is learned and the other unlearned; for much
as there is to deplore in the present state of society, we have
still beautiful instances of the most faithful and genuine
friendship existing between the serving and the served.&nbsp; It
is not, I am persuaded, this difference of position that is at
the root of the mischief; it is the mistaken <i>feeling</i> that
one class bears to another.&nbsp; It is the hard words that you
speak, and the unjust thoughts that you and your comrades
encourage each other to entertain towards the rich, that help to
make society wrong; and it is because the higher classes do not
honour you for your skill, industry, and ability, and acknowledge
<a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>their
dependence upon you, that this wrong is perpetuated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have sometimes wondered, if an angel were to be sent from
heaven to endeavour to set us all right on the subject of our
duties and feelings one towards another, whether he would give
his first lesson to the employers or the employed; but neither
party need wait for the extraordinary teaching of a celestial
visitant.&nbsp; An angel would bring with him no new
lesson-book&mdash;he would point out to us for our guidance a few
verses from an old and inspired volume; that have been trying to
make themselves heard amongst us for the last eighteen hundred
years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this,
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that
ye be not consumed one of another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be ye kind one to another, tender hearted,
forgiving one another, even as God for Christ&rsquo;s sake hath
forgiven you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one
of another; love as brethren, be pitiful, be
courteous.&rdquo;</p>

class="smcap">Towards</span> the close of 1853, I commenced a
Mothers&rsquo; Society, and the following letter will be found to
contain an account of its establishment and early progress.&nbsp;
It is addressed to a dear friend, in answer to a letter of
inquiries from her.&nbsp; As similar inquiries have frequently
been made since, by persons interested in the same way, I think
it best to give the letter entire:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">7 St James Square,

<p><span class="smcap">My very dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I fear
you must have thought me very dilatory in replying to your last
kind letter, containing so many inquiries respecting the
Mothers&rsquo; Society.&nbsp; In consequence of your asking for a
<i>minute</i> history of its rise and progress, and putting,
besides, so many definite questions, I felt that the limit of a
common letter would be quite insufficient, and I have therefore
been compelled to wait for a day of more than ordinary
leisure.&nbsp; As, I see, you request me to go back so far as to
tell you what made me think such a thing desirable or possible, I
must, indeed, lose no time in beginning.</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>Although it must be more than ten years since I had the
pleasure of working with you in the management of the Bath Female
Friendly Society, I dare say you have not forgotten what queer
characters we used sometimes to come in contact with.&nbsp; I
remember a few desperate cases, where, when everything else had
failed, we at last succeeded in making some impression through
their children.&nbsp; One of the most remarkable instances of
this kind I have related, just as it occurred, in a letter which
I addressed to the society, when I was obliged to be absent a few
weeks in the spring. <a name="citation110"></a><a
href="#footnote110" class="citation">[110]</a>&nbsp; From that
time, I have always been deeply impressed with the idea that,
under judicious treatment, this softer and better portion of
woman&rsquo;s nature might be so taken advantage of as to lead to
excellent moral results.</p>
<p>But I never had any definite idea of reducing these thoughts
to practice; and they would, in all probability, have remained
quietly in my own mind if I had not come in contact with those
whose juster views of the value and shortness of life had led
them to <i>work</i>, as well as think, whilst it is day.</p>
<p>One afternoon, the autumn before last, I was sitting alone,
and had taken up the <i>Times</i>, when my attention was arrested
by a speech from the Earl of Shaftesbury.&nbsp; I forget the
object of the meeting, neither do I remember the exact words
used, although the idea at once impressed itself.&nbsp; He was
speaking hopefully of the good effected through ragged and other
schools.&nbsp; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I have long
felt that until the homes of <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>these poor children are
better&mdash;until the fathers and mothers are better men and
better women&mdash;our schools can accomplish comparatively
little.&nbsp; I believe that any improvement that could be
brought to bear on the mothers, more especially, would effect a
greater amount of good than anything that has yet been
done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I laid down the paper, and thought for some time, wondering
what could be done, and wished that somebody would do
something.&nbsp; But I had advanced no further than this, when
the arrival of visitors gave my thoughts another direction.</p>
<p>The next morning, whilst I was busy with my children, I was
told that the city missionary wished to see me.&nbsp; The object
of his visit was to tell me that a large room in the
neighbourhood was to be rented for a Girls&rsquo; Evening School,
and he thought it could be spared one evening in the week for a
Mothers&rsquo; Meeting.&nbsp; He knew some poor women who would
attend; and he asked me to take the management of it.&nbsp; From
my ignorance of the practical working of such a society, I felt
very much at a loss to know how to commence it, and was inclined
to think that I had neither the ability nor the time to conduct
it.</p>
<p>I could not, however, but remember how remarkably my attention
had been several times drawn to this subject, and the various
incidents which had again and again impressed it on my
mind.&nbsp; But the thought that weighed most of all with me
was&mdash;I knew I had a most entire sympathy with poor mothers;
that of all things in the world, I most wished to try and do
something <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>to shew how much I cared for their great difficulties
and sufferings; and though I might fail to render them much real
service, I trusted the truthfulness of my feelings towards them
would manifest itself, and that this might lead to some good
result.&nbsp; At any rate, I resolved to try, and to trust that
the way would open, and that light would come.</p>
<p>It was on the first Monday in November 1853, that I walked to
the nicely lighted and pleasant room provided for us.&nbsp; About
seven or eight women were assembled, and two or three came in
afterwards.&nbsp; I thought they looked at me much as they would
have done at the entrance of the white bear from the Zoological
Gardens, that is,&mdash;provided he were caged; for the stare had
no fear in it, though abundance of curiosity.</p>
<p>They said they were glad I was come, for they did not know
what they were met there for; they &lsquo;s&rsquo;posed I
did.&rsquo;&nbsp; I said, I was prepared to explain it to them;
but I wished to begin by reading a few verses of Scripture.&nbsp;
This they submitted to pretty well; but as soon as it was over,
they began talking all round to each other, in by no means
particularly soft voices.&nbsp; I knew that, as long as the game
of &lsquo;Who can shout loudest&rsquo; was to be played, I had no
chance; and not wishing to shew my weak side at the first
meeting, I remained perfectly silent, and listened, as far as I
could, to the observations which were made principally <i>at
me</i>, but not to me.</p>
<p>At last, they seemed rather struck at the isolation of my
position, and there was a lull.&nbsp; Then I told <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>them I
certainly had not called them together without having something
to say to them.&nbsp; I had far too high an estimate of the value
of their time.&nbsp; As soon as they caught the idea that some
kind of improvement was contemplated in their domestic affairs,
they began again.&nbsp; If that was what I was after, I should
have had such and such an one, &lsquo;she sarved her children
dreadful.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then followed no end of narratives of the
wickedness of their neighbours; and many of the cruelties that
mothers can be guilty of, came out in detail.&nbsp; One woman
said, she was &lsquo;always a-trying to do &rsquo;em good, and
told &rsquo;em what they should do; but, instead of doing it,
they jist up and sarced at her in a minnit.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was
the more amused at this last expression, as I thought it rather
aptly described my own position just then, though I must, in
justice, pause here to remark that, with only one exception, I
have never <i>from the very first received direct impudence from
any of them</i>.&nbsp; When the hour expired, and we rose to
depart, I knew that very few who were there would return; but I
requested them to send those very wicked neighbours of theirs;
and as they themselves seemed impressed with the desirableness of
doing so, I left, with the hope that the publicans and sinners
might be brought to hear, though the Pharisees would not.</p>
<p>As I am giving this history simply from recollection, having
kept no kind of memoranda, I cannot be certain of perfect
correctness when I speak of numbers; but I remember the
attendance became less and less, until&mdash;I think it must have
been about the fourth <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>evening&mdash;I entered the room at
the usual hour, and no one was there.&nbsp; The general
arrangement of the room had been even more than usually carefully
attended to, through the thoughtfulness of our kind city
missionary.&nbsp; It was well lighted, and the fire burned
cheerfully.&nbsp; My chair was placed in a &lsquo;chosen
spot,&rsquo; and a Bible lay on the table before it; but no one
came.&nbsp; I opened the Bible, and read; and though I cannot
give any effect to this narrative by speaking of the remarkable
appropriateness of the passage that happened to fix my attention,
I distinctly remember losing, under the influence of its holy
power, all sense of vexation and disappointment; and the solitude
soon appeared in the light of a most valuable opportunity for
praying, long and earnestly, for those I so much desired to
serve.&nbsp; I felt perfectly resigned to His will; either to fit
me for it, to raise up others, or to give me to see clearly that
this was not the work He had appointed me to do.&nbsp; About a
quarter of an hour before the time for closing, a woman came in
with a bottle of medicine in her hand.&nbsp; She had been coming
to the meeting; but her husband had been taken ill, which had
obliged her to go in search of medicine for him instead.&nbsp; On
her return, she thought she would just step in and see how we
were getting on.&nbsp; I had noticed that this poor woman had
seemed far more interested than any one who had yet attended; and
I was glad of an opportunity of becoming better acquainted with
her.&nbsp; She told me that her husband had formerly been an
infidel; but through the influence of a tract that was <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>left at the
house, combined with the effect of the visits of the missionary,
he had become an entirely changed character.&nbsp; She described,
with great simplicity, how the alteration gradually manifested
itself; how, at first, he did not like her to see him praying;
and how she took care to keep out of the way at the time.&nbsp;
Then he came to praying before her, and then with her and the
children; and now, no day passed without their united
supplications ascending to the Author of their mercies.&nbsp;
Then followed the description of what John used to be, and what
he now was; what the house was then, and now.&nbsp; All this was
narrated with beautiful simplicity.&nbsp; I never felt more
emphatically that &lsquo;surely I know it shall be well with them
that fear God, which fear before him;&rsquo; and that the only
cure for the sting of poverty was, that every family should be
governed by the principles which influenced this.&nbsp; I need
hardly add, that the meeting that night was for my benefit.</p>
<p>But I am entering too much into detail, and must pass on more
rapidly.&nbsp; About six weeks after that solitary evening, there
were at least twenty-five present; and let me give you an idea of
the improvement in their manners.&nbsp; I was a minute or two
late.&nbsp; They were nearly all assembled.&nbsp; As I entered
the room, they all rose, and remained standing till I was
seated.&nbsp; And this was by no means in consequence of any
lectures I had given them on manners: I should have considered it
as much as my place was worth to have offered such
instruction.</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>From
having frequently heard a difficulty as to the time which these
meetings took from their work, I thought of a plan for supplying
their fingers, whilst their minds were occupied in listening to
what was passing in the way of instruction.&nbsp; Various
materials for clothing were provided, and issued to members of
the society, as required by them, at a reduction of twopence in
the shilling.&nbsp; Good patterns were also provided, free of
charge.&nbsp; In this way, during the winter, most of these women
made several garments for themselves and their children; and as
the payments were usually only a few pence at a time, the total
cost appeared to them very trifling.&nbsp; In addition to this, a
Savings&rsquo; Bank was established, and some of the depositors
saved as much as seven or eight shillings.</p>
<p>As the summer advanced, the attendance, of course,
lessened.&nbsp; The greater part of the poor people living in the
Potteries, being brickmakers, can follow this occupation only in
the summer, when they work early and late; and the wife often
works too.&nbsp; We therefore thought it best to give up meeting,
from July to the end of September.</p>
<p>As we parted, one of our members, a good woman, who had
interested me very much, came to me, and, with tears in her eyes,
spoke of the happy hours we had enjoyed there, and said the time
would seem long till we met again.&nbsp; We then little thought
<i>how</i> long it would be.&nbsp; The Potteries was one of the
first places visited by the cholera that year; and this good
woman, to whom I was most sincerely attached, was <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>one of the
first victims.&nbsp; She was attacked one morning, and died in
the evening.&nbsp; A sickly child, too, who had been long the
object of the greatest care and solicitude to his poor mother,
followed her in a few hours, and one grave received them
both.</p>
<p>When we assembled in October, in addition to the inroads which
death had made, a few members had left the neighbourhood; but
still so many returned, and brought with them so many companions,
that I saw it was quite impossible to carry on the society longer
single-handed.&nbsp; Neither was there any occasion for doing
so.&nbsp; Several ladies kindly offered their assistance, and we
are now regularly organised.</p>
<p>Another great advantage which we now enjoy is, that, within
the last few months, a new clergyman has come to the parish, who,
by his occasional presence among us, and the kind interest that
he takes in all connected with the society, is a source of much
encouragement to us, as well as valuable assistance.</p>
<p>And now having given you an account of what may be called the
building up of these meetings, I will answer your next
inquiry&mdash;&lsquo;How do you manage to interest the
mothers?&rsquo;&nbsp; I must begin what I have to say on this
subject by stating that I believe there is no society in
existence where there is so little difficulty in creating an
interest, as in a society of mothers.&nbsp; In fact, you have not
to create, but to take advantage of what already exists.&nbsp; A
woman who will come to such a meeting at all, <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>will be
sure not to be perfectly indifferent to the improvement of her
children; although it is lamentable to see how habitual
selfishness will sometimes almost obliterate even this first
principle of nature.&nbsp; But, believe me, there are few cases,
very few, where, under right influence, this feeling cannot be
restored, and brought into living action, and always with great
benefit to the general character.</p>
<p>We commence by reading a passage of Scripture, and with
prayer.&nbsp; In the prayer, besides mentioning the peculiar
difficulties and sufferings incident to a poor mother&rsquo;s
life, any cases occurring amongst them particularly demanding
sympathy are mentioned, in order to be made the subject of our
united supplications.&nbsp; I believe that this has done much to
give a kindly interest in one another; for the instances we have
had of their sympathy for each other in times of distress have
been truly beautiful.</p>
<p>When they have all settled to their work, and the money
affairs are over, I generally make a few inquiries as to what
occurred at the past meeting; whether any plan then recommended
has failed or succeeded.&nbsp; For instance, a better domestic
observance of the Sabbath was the subject for two evenings.&nbsp;
This led, among many other things, to a conversation on the best
way of arranging about the Sunday dinner; so that it really might
be the best in the week, and yet leave as little work as possible
connected with it to be done on that day.</p>
<p>Experiments in cooking, and, indeed, anything <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>belonging
to their pre-eminently practical life, they seem much to enjoy,
and they are eager to relate, at the next meeting, either success
or failure.</p>
<p>I find that, when they can be induced to make the effort,
their experience helps them to arrive at conclusions of far more
value than any mere theoretical suggestions; and I have often the
pleasure of seeing the ideas which I may have thrown out serve
them as a kind of scaffolding, useful only as enabling them to
erect a building more adapted to their own mode of life and
circumstances.</p>
<p>A few evenings since, I was saying to them how much better it
would be to try to employ and direct children&rsquo;s energies,
than to be so often punishing them for inconvenient
manifestations of them.&nbsp; I shewed them the German plan of
amusing children for a length of time, with little bundles of
sticks that could be arranged in a variety of forms; also, how to
cut out paper, patchwork, &amp;c.&nbsp; I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will find that children will keep themselves amused
much longer, and far more earnestly, if you will treat their
rational play with some respect, and not do violence to their
feelings, by applying to it such terms as &ldquo;mess, stuff,
bother.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>One woman looked up from her work, having evidently thoroughly
received the idea, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, now, how often I&rsquo;ve said to &rsquo;em,
&ldquo;Get along with your bother:&rdquo; I jist wish I
hadn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the next meeting, I asked this woman if she had tried any
of the amusements; she said&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>&lsquo;O ma&rsquo;am, I have never had such a week
before with the children; they builded all over the table two or
three times a-day; and I told them, when they made a very nice
house, to let mother see; and the little &ldquo;critters&rdquo;
were so pleased, and &ldquo;<i>we haven&rsquo;t had no
beatin</i>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>About a quarter before nine o&rsquo;clock, our missionary
comes in, and concludes all with a concise, well-adapted address,
and a short prayer.&nbsp; I must take this opportunity of
stating, that I attribute our success, under God&rsquo;s
blessing, quite as much to the excellent influence which he has
exercised without, as to anything that has been done
within.&nbsp; In visiting the women, and inducing them, in the
first place, to attend the meeting, he has taken a part which I
could not; and, by his wise and timely suggestions, he has often
saved me from mistakes.</p>
<p>We did not start with the rules as they now exist,&mdash;we
were not then ripe for them; but as the right time came, I
introduced them, and they were passed with the full consent of
the whole meeting.&nbsp; Hence the mothers view
themselves&mdash;and justly&mdash;as governed by their own
laws.</p>
<p>I see, you still further inquire how, with so many domestic
claims of my own, and not enjoying good health, I find time to
attend to such a society.&nbsp; Now, in alluding to this, you no
doubt were influenced by the recollection of Mrs Jellaby&rsquo;s
celebrated establishment; and have been thinking, when you pay us
your long-promised visit, whether you will be able to trace a <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>resemblance
in my children to the poor little neglected &lsquo;Peepy;&rsquo;
how much semi-cooked meat you will have to eat; whether the
potatoes will sometimes be lost by being placed in the
coal-scuttle, and so forth.</p>
<p>After all that has been written and said, both for and against
mothers of families being allowed to do anything besides
&lsquo;minding their own business,&rsquo; it seems to me that the
question resolves itself simply into this:&mdash;Is the
occupation in unison with home duties, and can it chime in with
them? or is it something that will divert the thoughts and
actions into an entirely different channel?&nbsp; Now, although
we may imagine it possible to work one&rsquo;s own mind up into a
strong interest in some &lsquo;Borrioboolah Gha,&rsquo; it is
rather too much to expect that the minds of those about us will
be equally interested.&nbsp; But if you could see the great
pleasure which my children derive from hearing about the society,
and working with me, you would be the first to beg me to continue
it for their sakes.&nbsp; On the morning succeeding a meeting,
they come round me with numerous inquiries after some mother or
baby, whom they have learned to know through hearing me speak of
them.&nbsp; They have, of their own accord, set apart one day in
the week for working for the little children of those mothers who
are very poor; and when, the other day, they heard me speaking of
a poor woman who was lamenting she could not read, they
immediately offered to go two or three times a-week to teach
her.</p>
<p>It seems to me, that the few hours a-day which we <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>set apart
for teaching our children, (for &lsquo;school,&rsquo; as we call
it,) has far less to do with the formation of their character,
than that which they see and hear constantly going on around
them.&nbsp; It is the every-day incidents of life that impress
children; and if it had only been for their sakes, I do not know
that I could have thought of anything better fitted to prepare
them for what I wish them to be,&mdash;followers of Him
&lsquo;who came not to be ministered unto, but to
minister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is another thing that helps me.&nbsp; You know, our
servants are neither &lsquo;necessary evils&rsquo; nor
&lsquo;natural enemies;&rsquo; they are, indeed, our friends and
helpers; and from remaining with us so long, they become as much
interested as we are, in everything that is going on; and, by
their sympathy and thoughtfulness in clearing away impediments,
they render us most valuable assistance.&nbsp; Thus, no mornings
are taken up abroad in inquiring for characters, or at home in
what is called &lsquo;looking after them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another plan I find very useful is, not to allow every day to
be encumbered with every kind of work.&nbsp; One day is set apart
for everything connected with this society, which has then the
best of my thoughts, and as much work expended upon it as can be
given without interfering with regular duties; and if it attempts
to intrude itself upon the wrong day, it is told to &lsquo;bide
its time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the &ldquo;ill health&rdquo; you
mention?&rsquo;&nbsp; Yes, that <i>is</i> a drawback, yet not
entirely so.&nbsp; It is certainly true that I have sometimes
risen from my bed to attend <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>the meeting; but then I always tell
the mothers so, and appeal to their compassion; reminding them,
that though I cannot speak loud, they <i>can</i> be quiet; though
I cannot enforce order, they can maintain it; and I really
believe that the secret of our so soon getting into order was the
working of the spirit of sympathy with me.&nbsp; As soon as they
felt that something depended upon them, they set about it in good
earnest.&nbsp; But that I may not by this convey to your mind any
wrong idea of the kind of discipline necessary, I will just say
that such appeal must always be made <i>en masse</i>; that
anything approaching to a monitorial system would be ruinous in
such a meeting, since nothing requires more watchfulness than to
keep down the spirit of jealousy.&nbsp; A good president must be
really absolute, though as little apparently so as possible.</p>
<p>Long as this letter is, I will not apologise for it.&nbsp; I
feel that to you there is no occasion for apology; for I have
perfect confidence in your sympathy.&nbsp; I could write another
still longer; and it would give me far more pleasure to do so
than this has given.&nbsp; It would be full of incidents, shewing
how the sunshine of kindness will bring to life that which,
having been so long covered up by the frost and snow of neglect,
had been supposed to be extinct.</p>

<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span><span
class="smcap">Some</span> time ago, I received a letter, in which
the following remark occurs:&mdash;&ldquo;Amongst the number of
women whom you have had to do with in this society, you surely
cannot always have escaped meeting with, what we call, queer
characters, even if not desperate ones.&nbsp; There is a class of
unmanageable women in the world, of whom I am more afraid than of
anything else; and the very thought of them has deterred me from
commencing a society open to any one, and, consequently, open to
such as I have referred to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The difficulty mentioned here will generally be experienced,
to a greater or less extent, at the commencement of these
societies; and in the establishment of them it should by all
means be anticipated and considered.&nbsp; But, after a time,
when the greater part of the members have conformed to law and
order, the general disposition will be manifested so strongly in
the right direction, that the rebellious individuals will either
make up their mind to conform, or to leave.&nbsp; There is a
quiet way of meeting sauciness, which very soon disarms it.&nbsp;
It is some trouble to be saucy; and <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>when nothing is gained by it, not
even amusement, the attempt is generally relinquished as not
worth the effort.</p>
<p>I think it was the second winter after we were established,
that a fine, tall woman presented herself, and said she wished to
be admitted.&nbsp; I told her of our usual arrangements, and
asked her if she would like to have some material for work.&nbsp;
She said, &ldquo;No; not that night: she should look about her,
and see how she liked it.&rdquo;&nbsp; She took a seat just
before me, sat with her arms crossed, and hardly kept her promise
of looking about her, as she stared at me all the time.&nbsp; In
about half an hour, she got up, and said she should go, as it was
duller than she had expected.</p>
<p>The next week, to my great surprise, she came again.&nbsp; She
said that she wanted some material for work; and asked if we had
anything good enough for her.&nbsp; She was supplied with what
was required, and she took it away to her seat; but brought it
back again in a few minutes, saying, &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t such
stuff as that she wanted.&rdquo;&nbsp; I took the flannel from
her, put it back into the box, shut the box, and went on reading,
leaving her standing at the table; while every one else was
quietly working and listening.&nbsp; She looked at me steadily
for some minutes, in the hope of my &ldquo;having a row with
her;&rdquo; but as I took no kind of notice, and continued to
read without even raising my voice, she presently walked across
the room, upsetting a few things in her way, opened the door,
and, bouncing out, banged it after her, so as to shake the whole
room.</p>
<p><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>During the next week I made a few inquiries about her,
and was told she was &ldquo;the best hand in the Potteries at a
row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law, ma&rsquo;am! have you got Mrs A&mdash; among
you?&nbsp; Why, she&rsquo;ll soon upset you all.&nbsp; Why, when
she goes with the men into the public-house, they&rsquo;re all
afeared of her.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s never no peace where she
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This account quite confirmed the opinion which I had formed,
that she was a woman of great energy and uncommon ability; while,
if that energy and ability could only be turned to some proper
use, she might be just as valuable as she was now
mischievous.&nbsp; But the difficulty was how to get at such a
person, with whom one had so little in common.&nbsp; I confess, I
rather hoped that I should see no more of her.&nbsp; But the next
week she was there again, and again asked for work.&nbsp; I gave
her what she had refused the week before, which she took without
saying a word, and went away to her seat.</p>
<p>Whilst taking the money for the work, and settling the
accounts, I did not require the women to be quiet,&mdash;that is
<i>their</i> time for saying to one another what they wish; so
that I did not take any notice of the very loud tone in which my
new and formidable member conversed, nor of her subject, which
was principally a running commentary upon my proceedings.&nbsp;
At length I took the Bible, and sitting down, all the mothers put
aside their work, and remain quite silent.&nbsp; This woman,
however, kept cutting out, and talking on, pretending that she
did not observe the change.&nbsp; After waiting a <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>minute or
two, I said to her&mdash;&ldquo;We do not continue the work while
the chapter is being read.&nbsp; We think it a respect due to the
Word of God to sit quietly and listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, I suppose, I must waste my time too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you think it waste of time; but you
certainly must do as the rest.&nbsp; No one is <i>obliged</i> to
come here, but whoever chooses to come <i>must conform</i> to our
rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw down her scissors, and sat out the reading with a
very ill grace.&nbsp; Had there been any one to side with her, I
believe we could hardly have escaped &ldquo;a scene,&rdquo; but
she seemed rather an object of dislike to the rest; they were
annoyed at the interruption which she had caused, and she met
with no encouragement.&nbsp; She subsided considerably after
another week or two; and her sole mode of annoyance consisted in
saying, partly to herself, and partly to her next neighbour,
while I was speaking, in a tone that I might or might not hear,
as I pleased&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> nothing new.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Everybody knows <i>that</i>, I sh&rsquo;d
think.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder where she pick&rsquo;d that
up!&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>I tried at first the effect of not hearing, but as that
experiment did not succeed, I thought I must adopt some other
means.&nbsp; One evening, I heard her muttering, in reference to
something which I had just said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew all that long ago, and a pretty deal more,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stopped, and looking directly at her, said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs A&mdash;, I have just heard you say, &lsquo;I knew
all that long ago, and a pretty deal more, too.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now,
if <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>that
is the case, I should like you to tell us what you do know.&nbsp;
The object of this meeting is to get all the information which we
possibly can, upon subjects of this kind, and I shall be
delighted to learn anything from you; and so, I am sure, will
every one else here.&nbsp; One of our rules is, that one person
shall speak at a time, but it does not at all follow that
<i>I</i> should always be the speaker.&nbsp; I will leave what I
was going to say, as any other time will do, and we will listen
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a murmur of dissatisfaction at this; but I quelled
it directly, stating, that &ldquo;I wished there should be no
interruption; we would all be perfectly quiet, and would listen
to what Mrs A&mdash; had to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a minute or two another woman attempted to speak, but I
stopped her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything you like, presently; but this is Mrs
A&mdash;&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Mrs A&mdash;! it was her time, indeed.&nbsp; There we
sat, the clock went &ldquo;tick, tick,&rdquo; the needles went
&ldquo;click, click,&rdquo; although most of the workers stopped
in astonishment.&nbsp; Even the babies did not relieve us by a
squall.&nbsp; The silence was terrible, Mrs A&mdash; would have
known how to have acted in a storm; there she would have been in
her element,&mdash;none could outstorm a storm better than she;
but this calm was dreadful.&nbsp; She had sense enough to know
she had brought this difficulty upon herself; that I was simply
standing on one side, to let her folly fall directly upon
herself.&nbsp; She did not say anything, but it was evident she
inwardly writhed under the infliction, even more than <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>I had
expected; and I have thought since, that the punishment partook
of the refinement of cruelty.&nbsp; After this silence had lasted
three or four minutes, I observed, that I supposed she did not
remember what she had intended to say; and I went on again where
I left off, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>When the meeting was over, and the women were going out, I saw
Mrs A&mdash; standing irresolutely near the door.&nbsp; She
evidently did not like to leave without &ldquo;giving it to me
well,&rdquo; and yet she had sense enough to know there was no
one to blame but herself.&nbsp; I called to her, and asked her if
she would arrange the work-bags for me; she came back, and before
she had finished, the other women were all gone, and we were
alone.&nbsp; I then said to her&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs A&mdash;, it has been no pleasure to me to make you
feel so uncomfortable this evening; I have been waiting for some
weeks past, in the hope that your own good sense would shew you
the necessity of accommodating yourself to our plans and
rules.&nbsp; I can scarcely make as much excuse for your
behaviour as I should for a child.&nbsp; A child is often
compelled to go where he does not like; but every one who comes
here, comes of her own free will, and need never pay a second
visit, if it is not agreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had never come a-nigh the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been uncomfortable this evening, I know; but
you forget how many evenings before this you have made <i>me</i>
uncomfortable.&nbsp; If only a very few were to act as you have
done, our meetings would be <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>brought into such disorder that it
would be folly to attempt to meet at all.&nbsp; One principal
thing for which many of these women value the meetings is, that
they are <i>quiet</i>.&nbsp; It would be no kindness to them to
bring them out of the bustle and confusion of home into another
scene of bustle and confusion.&nbsp; Now, will you answer me this
one question?&nbsp; Do you think I should be a fit person to
preside over this meeting, if I could not, and did not check such
annoyance and interruption as you have caused?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no; I do think I am a sort of a fool;&rdquo; and
the long pent-up feelings of mortification began to vent
themselves in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not think that,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have often looked at you, and admired the ability and energy
which you have shewn.&nbsp; Why, I think you could cut out work
fester than any three of the rest of us put together; and you
have a good idea of order and arrangement, too.&nbsp; I have
already learned some things of you, and you could help me a great
deal, if you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I shall come here any
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would advise you to stay away for a month.&nbsp; By
that time all that has passed will be forgotten.&nbsp; If you
will call on me at my house, this day week, in the afternoon, I
shall be happy to see you; and when we have had a long chat
together, we shall be better acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came.&nbsp; I found it as I had expected.&nbsp; Next to
the unrenewed nature, the evil had its rise in great physical <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>strength,
and mental energy never fully expended.&nbsp; Her husband was
what they call &ldquo;a quiet man,&rdquo; perhaps more easily
managed than she liked; and her two children went to school, and
did not give her much trouble.&nbsp; But it was not so much the
want of occupation, (for her pig-feeding establishment must have
made great demands upon her time,) as a kind of mental
restlessness, which nothing in her mechanical life could
absorb.&nbsp; The mischief done by a river in overflowing its
banks will never be remedied by damming the water back on itself;
it will only return again and again.&nbsp; Fresh channels must be
dug for it, and then the same element that previously spread
destruction, will produce verdure and fertility.</p>
<p>I was able to suggest several subjects to this poor woman,
which both interested and occupied her.&nbsp; She was one of the
most expeditious cutters-out of work that I have ever seen.&nbsp;
She reminded me of the lady who said &ldquo;her scissors knew the
way.&rdquo;&nbsp; During the first winter, and before the society
became so large, I was in the habit of cutting out most of the
work for the mothers, but now I engaged Mrs A&mdash; to come to
the room half an hour before the time, to help me.&nbsp; I used
to take patterns of some things that were not made up in the
room&mdash;things that I thought would be useful to them.&nbsp;
These I confided to her, with a quantity of paper, by which she
could reproduce them to any one who might wish for them.&nbsp;
Many a well-fitting garment to be seen in the Potteries has been
procured in this way.&nbsp; Since our plans have been altered,
and each <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>member cuts out her own work, many an unskilful,
trembling hand has been relieved by these &ldquo;scissors that
know the way.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several of our little orderly methods,
also, for which <i>I</i> have been complimented by visitors, were
originally suggested by the former disturber of our peace.&nbsp;
She is now a great reader.&nbsp; One of the last books which I
lent her was &ldquo;Sandford and Merton.&rdquo;&nbsp; She told
me, when she returned it, that she often kept her own boys, and
half-a-dozen others, quiet for an hour or two together, by
reading aloud to them.</p>
<p>The deep attention with which she always listens to the
reading of the Word of God, and the great improvement that has
taken place in her habits of life, induce me to hope that, if she
has not found, she is, at least, earnestly seeking Him who can
&ldquo;save to the uttermost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is another character, however, which is met
with&mdash;to me, far more difficult and trying than that to
which my friend has referred.&nbsp; Saucy women are seldom
deceptive.&nbsp; The surface is often worse than that which
remains hidden.&nbsp; But the bland, smooth-faced ones, who agree
to everything you say, compliment you upon everything you do,
smile sweetly alike at either censure or praise, and talk against
you as soon as your back is turned&mdash;what <i>can</i> be done
with such people?&nbsp; Fortunately for me (for I am still as
much at a loss as ever to answer this question), this is not a
common type of character in the Potteries.&nbsp; Although I have,
of course, had constant money transactions with the women, I
cannot now recall more than seven or eight <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>cases in
which the least attempt has been made to overreach and deceive;
and only in one instance have I lost money by lending it.</p>
<p>But the climax of evil in a woman is the habit of
drinking.&nbsp; There are many more drunkards amongst men than
amongst women, certainly; but whilst I have known many men
reform, I have known but very few women amend, after having thus
once fallen into this horrid vice.&nbsp; Whether it be that a
woman who has given way to intemperance feels so utterly degraded
and out of place, as to be hopeless of ever righting herself
again, and that she consequently proceeds desperately from bad to
worse, I cannot tell; but certainly the effects of this vice upon
herself, her husband, and her family, are terrible in the
extreme.&nbsp; No tongue can express what the child of the
drunken mother suffers.&nbsp; I cannot think of such misery
without tears.&nbsp; Two wretched little children, almost
destitute of clothes, came to my door one bitterly cold
day.&nbsp; The very sight of them made my children cry; and,
contrary to my judgment (for, alas! experience has made me wise),
I allowed them to dress them in warm woollen jackets.&nbsp; Not
many yards from the door, the mother was waiting for them: she
took them at once to the pawn-shop, stripped the little shivering
ones of the only warm garments which they had known for many a
day, disposed of them for a trifle, and got drunk with the
money.&nbsp; The next day, the sufferings of one of these
children were happily closed by death.&nbsp; I say, happily; for
death is the only release&mdash;a release to be <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>desired
beyond everything for the drunken mother&rsquo;s child.&nbsp;
Here we must weep for the living, and not for the dead.</p>
<p>The duties of life assigned to our working men and women
require a well-developed physical constitution, as well as that
mental power which gives firmness to endure.&nbsp; The early
sufferings, privations, and exposure which attend the infancy and
childhood of the drunkard&rsquo;s offspring, almost preclude the
possibility of the first; and the poor mind has, if anything, a
still worse chance.&nbsp; Then, with this enfeebled body and
mind, the child grows up to take his place in society, unable to
contend with physical labour, tortured with the constant cravings
for stimulants which he has inherited, and is an easy prey to the
numberless temptations which beset his path.&nbsp; Again, I ask,
is it any wonder that those who are daily watching these things
with unspeakable sorrow, should refuse to touch, taste, or handle
that which is the cause of such infinite misery?</p>
<p>Only a few women addicted to this fearful vice have joined our
society, and they have never continued long in it.&nbsp; When the
Word of God is constantly read and explained, when it is made the
foundation of <i>all</i> that is taught,&mdash;for our relative
and domestic duties have not there been passed
over,&mdash;deliberate living in sin becomes incompatible with
the pureness of the moral atmosphere diffused around.&nbsp; Many
a deep sigh have I heard, as the prayer for the poor drunkard has
gone up.</p>
<p>One evening, I was reading the fifteenth chapter of <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>St
Luke.&nbsp; When we came to the words&mdash;&ldquo;I will arise,
and go to my father,&rdquo; I said that some seemed to think that
only a certain kind of prodigal would be received back in this
way.&nbsp; I had often heard poor drunkards remark, that there
was no mercy for them&mdash;they were given up&mdash;they must be
lost; whereas if we went back a little in the history, and
remembered that it was said of this particular prodigal,
&ldquo;he wasted his substance in riotous living,&rdquo; it would
seem that the drunkard was especially meant.&nbsp; I observed a
poor, untidy, dirty woman sitting near me; she was weeping
bitterly: her distress was so great, that I never felt so much
difficulty in steadying my voice and going on.&nbsp; After the
meeting was over, she staid behind to speak to me.&nbsp; She
said&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am, I have felt <i>lost</i> for
years, as if nothing could save me; and the thought that I might
<i>hope</i> quite overcame me; it was so new to me, I thought I
should have sunk!&rdquo;&nbsp; This woman attended regularly for
a few weeks, and then she was obliged to remove to a
distance.&nbsp; I have not heard of her since.&nbsp; The
neighbours told me she was &ldquo;a deal steadier afore she
left;&rdquo; and I have hope in that word which &ldquo;shall not
return unto me void; but it shall accomplish that which I please,
and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to impress a portion of Scripture upon the minds of
our members, I request them, after the prayer is over, to repeat
a verse.&nbsp; This is not, of course, compulsory; but most of
them comply, or attempt to comply.&nbsp; As some of them cannot
read at <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>all, and others very imperfectly, there are not many
who repeat the passage correctly.&nbsp; I generally make a few
remarks upon the verse which I select, with the hope that they
will better remember it, and take it as their motto for the
week.&nbsp; I remember, one evening, I repeated&mdash;&ldquo;Fear
not, little flock; it is your Father&rsquo;s good pleasure to
give you the kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; I told them I once heard of a
man who had a great deal of money&mdash;more than he really knew
what to do with.&nbsp; He had a brother, who was very poor, and
who used sometimes to ask his rich brother for help.&nbsp; One
day, he begged for the loan of &pound;20.&nbsp; The rich brother
said he would advance the sum, on the condition that the poor
brother would write and promise never to trouble him any
more.&nbsp; I contrasted this with God&rsquo;s way of bestowing
His gifts upon us.&nbsp; He not only gives, but it is His good
pleasure to give (as we say, sometimes, we are happy to do so and
so), and bestow, not a perishing sum of money only, but a
kingdom.&nbsp; A poor chimney-sweeper&rsquo;s wife, sitting near
me, was evidently listening with even more than her usual
earnestness.&nbsp; She could not read, neither could her husband,
and they had no children old enough to go to school; therefore,
repeating a verse was to her a considerable undertaking.&nbsp;
She was, however, one of those energetic people who cannot bear
to be left behind.&nbsp; A fragment of a verse, if nothing more,
we were sure to get from her; and the mutilations did not trouble
her, as she was not conscious of them.&nbsp; I saw, upon this
occasion, she was bent upon getting possession of <i>this</i>
verse; and <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>I therefore took care to repeat it distinctly two or
three times.&nbsp; Next week, when it came to her turn, she
repeated, in a triumphant voice, as if she thought her verse
<i>now</i> as good as any one&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;Fear not,
little flock; yer Father will be very &rsquo;appy to give yer the
kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The narratives of Scripture, when explained and illustrated,
interest them more than any story-book that I have ever
found.&nbsp; The pressure of their domestic duties prevents many
of them from attending a place of worship; and the imperfect way
in which they read, obliges them to give more attention to the
words than to the sense, and keeps their stock of book-knowledge
very small.&nbsp; The history of Daniel in the lion&rsquo;s den
has the same charm for them as for children.&nbsp; I remember
once, when reading the verse&mdash;&ldquo;Then said Daniel unto
the king, O king, live for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, these words
strikingly shewed how perfectly calm and self-possessed the
prophet was.&nbsp; We might have supposed, from the terrible
position in which he was, that he would have said at once,
&ldquo;Oh, take me away from this dreadful place!&rdquo; but
instead of that, he did not even forget to preface his answer to
the king with the usual courtly phrase, &ldquo;O king, live for
ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; After the meeting was over, I observed two
women standing together, and talking about this.&nbsp; One of
them was an Irishwoman, and a professed Roman Catholic.&nbsp; She
was saying to the other&mdash;&ldquo;And jist to think now, that
he should have minded his manners, and all, at sich a time as
that.&rdquo;&nbsp; Little expressions of this kind are not only
<a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>amusing,
but valuable as a criterion by which to judge how far the women
understand what is said, and are interested in it.&nbsp; A friend
of mine, who attended the meeting once, was so much diverted by
some of these original sayings and doings, that she said
afterwards&mdash;&ldquo;I am afraid you must find the society of
polite people, who never say or do anything but what is strictly
correct, rather dull after this.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span><span
class="smcap">One</span> principal motive which has induced me to
write this little book is the hope that, by facts and
illustrations, I might remove the idea of <i>difficulty</i> which
many people attach to the management of such institutions as I
have described.&nbsp; Many excellent and kind-hearted ladies have
said to me, &ldquo;I should be so afraid to attempt
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It must require a person very clever, I
am sure; I should never be able to interest them.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These objections arise out of the mistaken notion that the
necessary qualifications belong more to the head than to the
heart; that some <i>great</i> thing is required of us, rather
than a <i>good</i> thing.</p>
<p>I received a letter, a few days ago, from a gentleman at
Plymouth, in which he tells me of the progress of a
Mothers&rsquo; Society in that town, conducted partly by his
wife.&nbsp; Speaking of one of their tea-meetings, at which he
had been present, he says, &ldquo;Whilst there, I was much struck
by the fact that, notwithstanding the great difference in our
circumstances, our <i>wants</i> are much the same.&nbsp; We all
have anxieties to be allayed, weaknesses to be supported, sins to
be forgiven, <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>hopes to be assured, and aspirations to be
encouraged.&nbsp; The maladies of all classes are the same, and
require the leaves of the tree given for the healing of the
nations.&nbsp; In this view we are one with the poorest and the
lowest, and we speak <i>to</i> them as one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is the realisation of this great thought of being one with
them, which is the true qualification.&nbsp; No amount of ability
will avail without this.&nbsp; When the head is simply to be
stored with knowledge, the greater the ability which the teacher
possesses the better.&nbsp; But the evils that we hope to remove
by meeting the poor in this way, have more of a moral than a
mental origin; and consequently they must be met as moral evils,
proceeding from the frailty to which we are all liable.&nbsp; The
great object of the teacher must be to awaken in the mind of the
poor mother a deep sense of her <i>responsibility</i>; and this
must be spoken of (and how truly!) as <i>our</i>
responsibility.&nbsp; The very slighting way in which poor girls
generally hear themselves mentioned, the little account in which
they are held, the absence, in fact, of almost everything that
can make them feel of importance in society, induce a habit of
thought very unfavourable to a conscientious discharge of their
duties.&nbsp; The feeling I speak of is something perfectly
distinct from either vanity or pride.&nbsp; It is the conviction
that interests of great importance are committed to us, out of
which arise duties for whose performance we shall be held
responsible, not only to <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>society, but to Him who has
consigned these sacred trusts to our care, saying, &ldquo;Occupy
till I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was lately visiting one of our poor women, whose progress I
have now had the pleasure of watching for some years.&nbsp; She
was lamenting the death of one of her favourite plants, and
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do like to see them pretty green things agin the
white curtains; &rsquo;tis something cheerful, like, for the
children to watch; they looks after the buds and flowers as if
they could see &rsquo;em grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I replied&mdash;&ldquo;The little slips you planted a few
weeks ago will soon be up; and in the meantime, your nice white
curtains will make the room look very neat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; these white curtains I bought last
ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t quite so nice as I should like &rsquo;em to
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smiled.&nbsp; I could not help looking back a few years, and
remembering the wretched hovel in which I had first become
acquainted with her and her children, when even a pair of clean
hands or a clean face would have been as great a rarity as snow
in harvest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs R&mdash;,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;you have
become particular, indeed.&nbsp; I see something new every time I
come.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know where you are going to
stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, I hope, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; We saves up, and gets
one little thing after another; and such rejoicing goes on here
at every fresh thing that comes.&nbsp; The children have saved
their halfpence for a long time past, and last week they bought
two new hymn-books; and the first thing we hear in the morning,
when we wakes, is their singing; and their voices is so
pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>The
children rushed to shew their treasures, carefully unwrapped them
from the paper, and produced two threepenny &ldquo;Curwen&rsquo;s
Hymn-books.&rdquo;&nbsp; No landed proprietor could have felt
richer, or looked happier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I often think, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the mother,
&ldquo;of how we was when you first came to us; and I often
think, too, how I <i>could dare to</i> keep such a place for my
poor husband and children as I did then.&nbsp; I hope the Lord
have forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was the secret of all this social improvement.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How can I <i>dare</i> to keep so much misery about me,
that I could and ought to prevent?&nbsp; How can I <i>dare</i> to
leave these children, whom God has entrusted to me to train for
Him, without trying in any way to prepare them either for time or
for eternity?&nbsp; How shall I dare to stand before God&rsquo;s
judgment throne, to give an account of the deeds done in the
body?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is this awakening of conscience that alone
enables a poor mother to see her true position, and gives her the
courage and resolution to do her best for her husband and
children, in the face of difficulties of which the rich have
scarcely any idea.&nbsp; Where conscience has slumbered long, or,
as in most cases, has never been aroused, the progress will often
be slow; but let this right principle be once established, and
the work is done.</p>
<p>In introducing subjects of a domestic nature, the word
&ldquo;<i>us</i>&rdquo; should be more frequently used than
&ldquo;<i>you</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is well sometimes to speak
particularly of our own difficulties and mistakes; it helps our
listeners <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>to regard us as fellow-sufferers&mdash;as friends, who
can understand and sympathise with them.&nbsp; When a poor mother
tells us how much misery the bad behaviour of her children is
causing her, we must not say (though it might be true),
&ldquo;Ah! that is just the natural consequence of all your bad
management; if you had only done what I advised, it would not
have happened.&rdquo;&nbsp; It must be&mdash;(and what mother
cannot truthfully say so?)&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! I can feel for you;
for my children trouble <i>me</i> a good deal sometimes, and
occasion me much anxiety.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what I should
do, if I could not bring them to God in prayer, and hope in His
mercy for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one occasion, while about to leave home for a few weeks, I
received a message from a poor woman that several of her children
had been attacked by fever.&nbsp; I could not, of course, go to
her then; but I wrote to her the next day from the
sea-side.&nbsp; I happened to mention, in my letter, that I was
under some anxiety for the health of one of <i>my</i>
children.&nbsp; In her reply, after thanking me for my
remembrance of her, she said, &ldquo;And I thank you very much
for telling me about your own child being ill.&nbsp; I pray for
her, too, when I pray for my own children; and I seem to feel
more sure that God will hear me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the first year, as I have already mentioned, I had to
conduct this society alone; being without the kind assistance
which I now enjoy.&nbsp; I was, of course, very anxious that
nothing should ever prevent my being there at the appointed
time.&nbsp; I had at one time, <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>for some days, been suffering from
toothache; and when the day for the meeting came, I was in such
an unnerved state, that the slightest noise distressed me very
much.&nbsp; But when the evening came, I felt that I must
go.&nbsp; I remember standing at the foot of the stairs,
trembling in every nerve; and wondering how it was possible to
mount to the top, and go into the room to face all the
women.&nbsp; I had, indeed, to look up to &ldquo;Him who giveth
power to the faint;&rdquo; and He did not forsake me.</p>
<p>After the preliminary business was over, and as I sat down to
read, I said, &ldquo;Now, though you are generally so quiet and
orderly, I must ask you to-night to be, if possible, still more
so.&nbsp; I have been suffering very much from pain in my face;
and it has made me so nervous, that I cannot bear any
noise.&nbsp; When my children came to me to-day, after dinner,
though they tried to be quiet, yet even their moving about made
me so much worse, that I had to send them away to the
nursery.&nbsp; After they were gone, and the room was still, I
thought that some of you, no doubt, suffered sometimes just in
the same way, and that you had no nursery to send your children
to; and I felt very sorry for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mrs A&mdash; mentioned in a former chapter was there: she
had become a most zealous champion of mine.&nbsp; I cannot help
laughing now at the recollection of her tall, commanding figure,
as she sat that evening bolt upright in her chair, looking round
with an air of defiance, as much as to say, &ldquo;Let me see any
one <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>dare
to make a noise.&rdquo;&nbsp; If a chair creaked, or scissors
dropped, her head was round in an instant.&nbsp; A little,
unfortunate boy, about four years of age, who came with his
mother because he could not be left at home, was singled out as
her special victim.&nbsp; He could not move, however quietly,
without her threatening face and finger being directed towards
him.&nbsp; She seemed to exercise some mysterious spell over him,
as he scarcely withdrew his eyes from her; and at last, when a
halfpenny rolled off his lap under the table, he instantly
followed it, and remained out of sight, as if unable to face her
again after <i>that</i>.&nbsp; The energy of her character
communicated itself to her needle.&nbsp; Presently this noisy
needle stopped.&nbsp; I did not notice it at first, thinking
that, perhaps, she was watching some fresh victim; but, as she
continued idle, I looked up from my book, and said, &ldquo;Are
you waiting for anything, Mrs A&mdash;, that I can give
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am, you see I forgot to bring the sleeves
out of the box, when I fetched my work, and I can&rsquo;t go on
any longer without &rsquo;em; but I have got such thick shoes on,
I thought I should make such a racket in fetching &rsquo;em, that
I should upset you altogether, and I had rather not finish my
work than do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew what a self-denial it must be to her not to drive on to
the end of her work, when she had intended to do so; and I
appreciated her kind consideration accordingly.</p>
<p>It has been quaintly said, that &ldquo;there are more points
in which a Queen resembles her washer <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>woman than in which she does
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without dwelling upon these extremes, nothing
is more certain than that whenever a lady goes amongst the poor,
hoping to benefit them by her influence, she must be impressed
much more by the points of resemblance that exist between them,
than by the points of difference.&nbsp; Mothers&rsquo; Societies
have a peculiar advantage in this respect.&nbsp; The sufferings
and joys attendant on the mother&rsquo;s life are common to all,
and enable us to realise, more than any other circumstance or
relation in life, that we are all children of one great
family.&nbsp; The best lessons we can find for our poor sisters
will be always those which we learn from our own
hearts&mdash;from our own actual every-day experience.&nbsp;
Sometimes I have repeated a portion of Scripture with them, which
I had previously read with my own children; telling them what
remarks I made upon it, and what the children said about
it.&nbsp; This, besides interesting and amusing them more than a
common explanation, has a better effect than saying, &ldquo;You
should teach your children so and so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should be afraid of the accusation of &ldquo;telling as new
what everybody knows,&rdquo; if I had not so often seen good and
excellent people, from whom I could learn much on most other
points, almost entirely fail in anything which they attempted
amongst the poor, just because they did not recognise the fact
that the law of &ldquo;doing as we would be done by&rdquo;
applies as much to our intercourse with the poor as with our
equals.&nbsp; I remember a case in point.&nbsp; One of our <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>poor
mothers had for some months brought with her a very fine
baby.&nbsp; He was a beautiful child, and so sweet-tempered, that
she had no difficulty in keeping him quiet.&nbsp; She was very
proud of him, of course, and used to seat him on the table, and
resort to a variety of little man&oelig;uvres to induce us to
notice and praise him.&nbsp; But when he began to cut his teeth,
a sad change occurred.&nbsp; He became thin and pale, and so did
the poor mother, through her night-watching, and hard work; and
we could hardly recognise in them the bright child and happy
mother we used to see.&nbsp; At last, the little fair head became
covered with sores&mdash;very sorrowful to witness; and, instead
of now shewing off her child, the poor stricken mother concealed
him as much as possible with her shawl, and sat apart from the
rest of the company.</p>
<p>One evening, a visitor came in and staid about an hour with
us.&nbsp; She evidently had not been much accustomed to such
society, and did not feel at home in it.&nbsp; Whilst I was
taking the money for the work, she tried to talk to some of the
women, but I saw that she found great difficulty in it.&nbsp;
Presently, a feeble cry attracted her attention to the poor baby;
with a look of great disgust, she said to the mother&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what have you been doing with that child&rsquo;s
head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; answered the
mother, hoping, I suppose, that she had mistaken the
question.&nbsp; It was repeated.&nbsp; The mother looked very
angry, and <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>replied, &ldquo;I hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t been doing of
nothing with it.&nbsp; I suppose rich people&rsquo;s babies get
bad heads, sometimes, as well as poor people&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many in the room sympathised with her, as I plainly saw, when
looking up from my account-book.&nbsp; It seemed as if an evil
spirit had suddenly alighted amongst us, and taken possession of
us all; for every countenance looked more or less angry.&nbsp;
Such is the wonderful power of a few words.&nbsp; When shall we
ever duly estimate the omnipotence of words?&nbsp; I had finished
my accounts, so I rose from my seat, and went across the room to
fetch something that I did <i>not</i> want; and, as I passed the
offending head, I stroked the little pale face, and
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor baby! how sad it is that it must begin to suffer
so soon, and give its poor mother so many anxious nights and
weary days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baby smiled upon me its accustomed smile; and, by the time
I was back to my seat, I saw the mother&rsquo;s head bent over
the child; the quiet tears were dropping upon its face, and the
evil spirit was gone.</p>
<p>Now, this lady was by no means of an unkind disposition; she
would have given us money if we had asked for it, and would have
exerted herself far more than many, to render us any real
service.&nbsp; She might truly have said&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And yet it was never in my soul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To play so ill a part;<br />
But evil is wrought by want of thought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as want of heart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>The
most beautiful and touching lessons on this subject are to be
found in the life of our Saviour!&nbsp; Of course a <i>word</i>
or a <i>message</i> from Him could have conveyed the miraculous
healing power; but in most cases He chose to touch the sightless
eye, to put His finger into the deaf ear, and to take her that
was dead by the hand.&nbsp; Even the poor leper, whom no one
would scarcely pass on the road&mdash;who had &ldquo;sat
apart&rdquo; for years, a stranger to all human
sympathy&mdash;what must that touch have been to Him!&nbsp; Jesus
knew that a double healing was required here, not only for the
body covered with sores, but for the spirit, wounded by long
neglect and estrangement.&nbsp; Each must be healed, before the
feelings of a man and a brother could return.&nbsp; A word or a
message could have effected the first, but the touch accomplished
both.</p>
<p>And yet how incomparably greater was the distinction that
existed between Jesus and this poor man, compared with that which
exists between the highest lady of the land and the poor
cinder-picker at Paddington!&nbsp; We hear often about the
condescension of the high towards the low; yet, how it all fades
away in the light of the life of Him &ldquo;who, though He was
rich, yet for our sakes became poor!&rdquo;&nbsp; We are
commended sometimes for the few spare hours which we give to the
poor; but what are these to His gifts, who always &ldquo;went
about doing good;&rdquo; who sought not &ldquo;to be ministered
unto, but to minister;&rdquo; and who closed all by &ldquo;giving
His <i>life</i> a ransom for many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haydon remarked, about his pictures, &ldquo;I was never <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>satisfied
with anything I did, until I had forgotten what I wished to
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; With the example of Christ before us, at which
to aim, it will surely be long before any of His followers will
be able to say of <i>their</i> work that they are
<i>satisfied</i>.</p>

<p><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Now</span>, all this
kindness, sympathy, and so forth, that you talk about, are very
well in their way; but you surely find you cannot do everything
you wish amongst the poor by these means?&nbsp; What do you say
to them about their dirty ways, their bad management, neglect of
their children, and all that sort of thing?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
answer to this question, put to me a short time ago, would occupy
more space than could be spared in the limits of a small
book.&nbsp; I will not, therefore, attempt more than a single
illustration in reply.</p>
<p>One subject that comes under my notice, very frequently, is
the inquiry for places of service for the daughters, sisters, and
friends of the higher class of women in our society.&nbsp; Many
secrets of service have been confided to me; and I ought,
therefore, to be wise; but the subject is difficult.&nbsp; It is
painful to be constantly hearing from mistresses that there are
scarcely any good servants to be met with; and from servants,
&ldquo;there is no good places going, scarce.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Something must be wrong.&nbsp; That two classes so necessary to
each other, and intended by the wise Disposer of all events <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>to bless
and benefit each other, should entertain such feelings of
animosity and ill-will, is deeply to be deplored.&nbsp; If there
is any remedy for so great an evil, if any solution of so
difficult a problem is possible&mdash;here, almost more than on
any other subject, is there room for the whole energy of the
philanthropist&mdash;here is one of the most direct roads that
can offer, to the elevation of those who greatly need raising,
and to the amelioration of our whole social system.</p>
<p>I think it must now be three or four years since several
circumstances brought this matter more prominently before
us.&nbsp; I said that we would give up one evening to the special
discussion of it.&nbsp; I appointed the next week, and invited
the mothers to bring with them their own daughters, and any young
people they liked.&nbsp; The number that came, shewed that the
subject was popular with them.</p>
<p>It was not difficult to find an appropriate Scripture lesson
for the evening.&nbsp; The Old Testament abounds with interesting
reference to servants.&nbsp; It is remarkable that the
first-recorded appearance of an angel in this world was to a
servant&mdash;Hagar.&nbsp; Abraham&rsquo;s servant, Eliezer, was
to him as his right hand.&nbsp; The character which we
particularly dwelt upon was Rebecca&rsquo;s nurse,
Deborah,&mdash;beginning at the first mention of her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And they sent away Rebecca, their sister, and her
nurse.&rdquo;&nbsp; We traced her probable life, as can easily be
done from the history that is given us of the families in which
she lived; the long quiet years with Isaac and Rebecca alone,
when she doubtless <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>had her trials, arising, perhaps, from the want of
perfect truthfulness in her mistress, or from the quiet,
contemplative disposition of her master, who did not always
appreciate her efforts to please.&nbsp; Then came two little boys
to be nursed, who, while they gratified her pride, gave her as
much trouble as little boys of the present day.&nbsp; How often
the nurse and mother conversed together about them, as they grew
up to be young men!&mdash;Deborah sometimes, with a heavy heart,
not liking to tell the mother all that went on behind her
back.&nbsp; Her earlier discovery of the vast difference in the
dispositions of the brothers, had already awakened in her mind a
fear that trouble was in the distance.&nbsp; And when the trouble
came&mdash;when the little household, once so peaceful, was
distracted by the contention of the brothers&mdash;when the
uncongenial daughters-in-law, who were a grief of mind to Isaac
and Rebecca, were introduced into the family&mdash;when her
mistress discovered too late, that whatever is purchased at the
expense of truth, brings only sorrow&mdash;and when at last she
had to witness the distress of her mistress in parting with her
favourite son,&mdash;through all this, how often must the kind
assistance and sympathy of this faithful servant have been
sought! how many tears shed by the poor mother in secret were
wiped away by the hand of this unfailing friend!</p>
<p>After the last kind offices were performed for Rebecca, we
find Deborah in Jacob&rsquo;s family, living her old life over
again in the care of his children, and winning love and respect
even from Rebecca&rsquo;s lawless <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>descendants.&nbsp; Is it any wonder,
if, after all this, a chosen spot, &ldquo;under an oak,&rdquo;
was selected as the place of her burial, and that the numerous
family who attended her to the grave should have wept so much,
that the name of the place ever after was called
&ldquo;Allon-bachuth,&rdquo; the &ldquo;oak of
weeping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, how many times, through all these eventful years,
difficult and trying circumstances must have occurred: long
illness, perhaps; quarrelsome children to contend with; great
changes in the household management; and so forth?&nbsp; A modern
servant would have said, many times over, &ldquo;Well, I
can&rsquo;t stand this; I must be off, and try for something
easier.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If people will get into such messes,
they must get out of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is no business
of mine: all I have to do is to take care of myself;&rdquo; and
off she would have gone.&nbsp; After repeating this many times,
is it any wonder that, instead of finding a home in the house of
a master&rsquo;s favourite son, and attended to her grave by a
weeping family, she finds herself an outcast in the world, and
understands the true and bitter meaning of what, in the heyday of
her health and strength, she used boastingly to sing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I care for nobody, no, not I,<br />
And nobody cares for me?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But now, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said one of the women,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to speak of places as
if they could be always stopped in.&nbsp; I have had my daughter
ill at home for months.&nbsp; She was expected to be on her legs
from seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning till twelve at <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>night, and
only two hours out every other Sunday: she had to sleep in a room
beside the kitchen, so that she never changed the air hardly; and
she got so ill, that I am sometimes afeard she&rsquo;ll never get
well again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;some
missuses is so mean, they wouldn&rsquo;t like anybody like you to
know; so that you might go to a house many times, and never find
it out: but they stints the poor servants in their food and their
rest, and seems to be always a-thinking how much they can get out
of &rsquo;em, and how little they can give &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure I know people about here that ain&rsquo;t fit to
take care of a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several others spoke to the same effect.</p>
<p>At last I said, &ldquo;I should, indeed, be sorry for you to
suppose that I think it is entirely the fault of servants that we
are doing so badly in this way at the present time.&nbsp; So far
from it, I think mistresses are quite as much to blame as
servants.&nbsp; But it would not be a wise thing for us to spend
the little time we have together here in talking about what we
cannot help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistresses tell me, that it is the bad servants that
put them out; and you tell me it is the bad mistresses that put
you out.&nbsp; The sooner both parties begin to make some
alteration the better.&nbsp; But as I am the only mistress here
to-night, it is only waste of time talking about
mistresses.&nbsp; And I want to ask you, first, if you do not
think <i>you</i> have something <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>in <i>your</i> power?&nbsp; Is there
nothing <i>you</i> can do to make things better than they are
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one answered; so I continued, &ldquo;I will tell you about
a servant I once knew very well.&nbsp; Her name was not Jane, but
I will call her by that name now.&nbsp; From fourteen to sixteen,
she was employed, under an upper-nurse, in taking care of some
little children; but, as she wished to be a cook, her mother
found a place for her as kitchen-maid, where she was under a
servant celebrated for her good cooking and bad temper.&nbsp; The
only time Jane had for going out was Sunday afternoon, when she
always went home to see her mother.&nbsp; For the first four
weeks she brought home nothing but complaints of her place: it
was so hard; the tyrannical cook was intolerable to live with;
the kitchen was so hot, &amp;c.&nbsp; With many tears and
lamentations she besought her mother to take her away from the
place.&nbsp; The mother, after making careful inquiry, found that
the cook was really a difficult and trying woman to live with;
but that she was a good teacher; and that the toil of which Jane
complained would, in the end, be the means of her getting a more
thorough insight into her work.&nbsp; She ascertained, too, that
though Jane was fully occupied all day, she was never kept up at
night; therefore, she was not likely to suffer in health: and as
to the hot kitchen, that was the more trying to Jane, from her
having previously been accustomed to be out of doors half the day
with the children; but as cooking <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>is usually accomplished in a hot
kitchen, the sooner she learned to bear that the better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sunday after all these inquiries had been made,
Jane came home, and, as usual, began her complaints; the mother
stopped her, by saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have been inquiring this week all about your
place, and I find there are in it some things very uncomfortable
and trying; but it is just the place where you can learn to be a
good cook, and, whatever you may think of it, Jane, I mean you to
stop there two years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O mother!&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;how can you
be so cruel!&rsquo; and she burst into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jane,&rsquo; said her mother, &lsquo;when the
boys went out to work, you know how Jim used to complain about
how he was teased in the carpenter&rsquo;s shop, and how bad
Harry&rsquo;s hands used to get with the bricks; they used to
come home awful tired in the evening; but I said to them, as you
know, &ldquo;Well, boys, it is no good to give in; we can&rsquo;t
have nothing in this world without trying for it.&nbsp; All this
suffering and hard work will make men of you, and make you worth
something.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want my boys to be gingerbread
people, that can&rsquo;t do nothing, and can&rsquo;t bear
nothing; you must just face about, and meet your troubles, and
it&rsquo;ll be the making of ye by and by.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so,
Jane, now I say the very same to you.&nbsp; I had to pay
something for the boys&rsquo; learning their trades, and to keep
&rsquo;em, too; but you are both paid and kept while you are <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>learning
yours; and so you must make up your mind to leave off grumbling,
put your own shoulder to the wheel, and I say to you, as I did to
them, it will be the making of ye by and by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane knew her mother always meant what she said, and
after she had made up her mind it was no use arguing with her;
and she went back to her place, feeling that, whatever she might
have to endure, all she could do was to make the best of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the end of the two years she left; but she was a
good cook,&mdash;not hurt by her hard work, although I know
well&mdash;for I have heard her speak of it many times&mdash;her
work was very hard for the body, and trying to the mind.&nbsp;
She was immediately afterwards engaged by a family, who lived
near her old mistress; and had twelve pounds a-year.&nbsp; After
being there six years, through some changes in the household, she
left; but she enjoyed the reputation of being the best cook in
the neighbourhood, and was immediately offered a situation in a
large establishment, at wages of sixteen pounds a-year.&nbsp;
Here she remained ten years, and then married, having saved
upwards of two hundred pounds: for, besides good wages, she had
occasionally received presents from various members of the
families in which she had lived, who valued her exceedingly, and
speak of her to this day with respect and affection.&nbsp; She
was married from her mistress&rsquo;s house, where a wedding
breakfast was provided.&nbsp; When she went off with her husband,
the whole family assembled to bid her farewell, and express their
good wishes; and one of the <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>great boys did not forget to throw
an old shoe after them, for luck.&nbsp; The last time I saw her,
she was in a most comfortably furnished cottage, nursing her
baby; and, amongst other things, she said to me&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The best thing that ever happened to me in my
life was my mother saying to me, &lsquo;Whatever you may think of
it, Jane, I mean you to stay there two years.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of my party was a gipsy-girl, about thirteen years of
age.&nbsp; She seemed to listen to this story with great
interest; and after I had ended, she exclaimed, without
addressing herself to any one in particular&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will learn to do something <i>well</i>; I am
determined I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is capital,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;it is just that
resolution which is wanted; everything else is sure to
follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best servant I ever had was entirely self-taught:
she was the eldest of ten children, and spent her life, till she
was fifteen, in &lsquo;holding the baby;&rsquo; then she went to
a house in our neighbourhood, as under-nurse, and to help the
other servants when required.&nbsp; She was so obliging, that she
became a favourite with every one.&nbsp; The nurse taught her to
read and sew; the young ladies taught her to write; the cook
found her so handy that, after she had been in the nursery three
years, she begged her mistress to allow her to have her in the
kitchen.&nbsp; She came to me two years after that, able and
willing to put her hand to any kind of work required; she
remained with me six years, and then married a respectable
carpenter.&nbsp; She <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>is now in America; and in the last
letter which I received from her, she told me that her husband
was earning four pounds a-week by his trade, and she could earn
one pound a-week by her dairy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said one of the women,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see, it wasn&rsquo;t <i>all</i> good
management that made these people you tell us about so
prosperous; it was partly good luck,&mdash;they got good
places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see that; but it was their good name that got
them the good places, and their good behaviour that enabled them
to keep them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; I see,&rdquo; said another;
&ldquo;&rsquo;course they wouldn&rsquo;t have stopped there, if
they hadn&rsquo;t been worth something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is this &lsquo;<i>being worth something</i>&rsquo;
that has a great deal to do with it, I assure you.&nbsp;
Supposing I were to send for a carpenter, and give him some wood,
and tell him to make me a box; and that in the evening, when I
looked at his work, I found that he had made such mistakes in
cutting it out and putting it together, that it was all spoilt;
that there was no possibility of making a box out of it; and all
that he had done for me was to make the material good for
nothing.&nbsp; I should say to him, &lsquo;I cannot pay you for
your work.&nbsp; You have deceived me in professing to be able to
do what it seems you cannot do; you have injured me by destroying
my property; and I cannot recommend you to any one
else.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, who would call me unjust for this?&nbsp;
But what would be thought of a master if, when he had sent away
one spoilt dish after another from his table, <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>he were to
send for the cook, and say to her&mdash;&lsquo;I engaged to give
you a home in my house, and to pay you certain wages, on
condition that you cooked my food nicely, and took care of the
property committed to your charge.&nbsp; I have fulfilled my part
of the engagement; you have not fulfilled yours.&nbsp; If you
really cannot cook properly, then you did me an injustice in
taking my money, and accepting the shelter of my house.&nbsp;
Perhaps it only arises from carelessness;&mdash;I will give you
another trial, but I must be just to myself at the same time I
shall not pay you any wages for this day&rsquo;s work,&mdash;you
have not earned any; and your being paid for the future will
depend upon whether you do what you engaged to do, or
not.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, who could say this was unjust? and yet, I
dare say, the self-styled cook would go back to the kitchen and
say, &lsquo;She had never heard of such a thing in her
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not remember ever employing a carpenter who could
not do what I required of him; not so well always, perhaps, as it
might have been done, but still he did it.&nbsp; But how many
cooks, housemaids, and nurses have I seen entirely fail in their
engagements.&nbsp; It arose, not from inferior capacity, but from
the great mistake which the girls had made, in supposing that
they could perform the very important duties assigned to them in
life, without preparation.&nbsp; A boy who intends to be a
carpenter, begins, as early as he can, to observe how the work is
done; he spends years in patiently learning one branch of his
trade after another, before he asks for wages; consequently, he
generally <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>gives satisfaction to his employers, and often remains
with one master for many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;how
<i>are</i> we to prepare our girls for service?&nbsp; Our houses
and our ways is so different from gentlefolk&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I
really don&rsquo;t know what we can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not wonder at your saying this; I have often felt
for you in this difficulty.&nbsp; I think your houses are not,
perhaps, quite so much like gentlefolk&rsquo;s as they might
be.&nbsp; A person with good taste would prefer a clean cottage,
any day, to a dirty palace.&nbsp; A bright, clean grate is just
as much an ornament to your room as to a lady&rsquo;s
drawing-room; and when you set your eldest girls to clean, if you
were more particular about <i>how</i> they did it, many a good
lesson might be given.&nbsp; But your principal hope is, I think,
in this kind of apprenticeship of which I have spoken.&nbsp;
Neither wages nor comfort, so long as the health is not
endangered, should be the chief consideration in choosing a
girl&rsquo;s first place.&nbsp; She should go from you with the
impression on her mind that the future of her life depends very
much upon herself; that what makes people valued, is their being
valuable; that wealth is not to be obtained by wishing for it,
but by a long, determined course of patient continuance in
well-doing, and a resolution not to be daunted by
difficulties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl prepared for her work in this way, would feel a
self-reliance that would tend very much to keep her from letting
herself down to anything low.&nbsp; She would also be in a
condition to make, what is called, <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>&lsquo;her own terms&rsquo; with her
mistress.&nbsp; By this, I do not mean to ask for high
wages,&mdash;there is no fault to be found with the amount of
wages given at the present day; but to ask for those privileges,
without which a servant cannot long continue to keep herself
respectable.&nbsp; I will tell you what I think a girl, who could
faithfully perform her part of the contract, would be justified
in asking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1st.&nbsp; That she might have as much of the Sunday to
herself as the general arrangements of the household would
permit.&nbsp; The commandment which tells us all to
&lsquo;remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy,&rsquo; has
especially said that servants are to rest on that day.&nbsp; No
one is likely long to go on right who has no time to read the
Bible&mdash;that great chart intended to guide us through
life,&mdash;without time to attend the public means of grace, and
without leisure to prepare for that world where the serving and
the served must stand side by side, to give up their account to
the great Master and Judge of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2d.&nbsp; She has a right to ask for the punctual
payment of her wages on the quarter-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3d.&nbsp; She has a right to ask that some little
portion of the day may be considered her own time.&nbsp; The
precise time must depend upon the habits of the family.&nbsp;
Generally, after eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening would be
convenient; but when the dinner-hour is late, and much company is
kept, some other hour must be fixed.&nbsp; Sometimes&mdash;with
nurses, for instance&mdash;it has been found better to let them
take all the needlework time, <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>on one or two days of the month, for
their own work.&nbsp; <i>Some time there must be</i>, or a
servant cannot do credit to her place, by keeping herself neat
and respectable.&nbsp; But the time should never be
<i>stolen</i>: a mistress pays for time, and it is her
right.&nbsp; There must be a distinct understanding between the
mistress and servant; and I do not hesitate to say, from my own
experience, that such an arrangement would be found mutually
advantageous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the meeting was over, several little groups might be
seen in various parts of the room, engaged in earnest
conversation.&nbsp; I heard one of them say it was &ldquo;a sight
clearer to her than ever it had been before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About two years after this conversation, a woman called at my
house, one morning, bringing her two daughters with her,
apparently about seventeen or eighteen years of age.&nbsp; I
remembered she had formerly attended our meeting, but she had
since removed from the immediate neighbourhood.&nbsp; After the
first inquiries had passed, she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you remember, ma&rsquo;am,
about two years ago you talked to us at the Mothers&rsquo;
Meeting, one evening, all about servants and missuses, and such
like.&nbsp; I was there, and these two girls.&nbsp; We had been
puzzling ourselves a deal, for some time before, to know what was
best to do; and we understood what you said, and liked it; and it
seemed to make us see things better than we had ever done
before.&nbsp; I had heard of some places for them; but we were
afraid <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>they would be overworked, and all that.&nbsp; As we
were going home, the girls said they would try for it: they
didn&rsquo;t want to be &lsquo;gingerbread people,&rsquo;
either.&nbsp; So they took heart, and went to work, and they have
been hard at it ever since.&nbsp; They ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t very
stout, you see, ma&rsquo;am; for they&rsquo;ve had plenty of
work, and none too much to live upon.&nbsp; But she&rsquo;s a
cook (pointing to the eldest), and I&rsquo;ll be bound no
master&rsquo;ll ever send for her to say she&rsquo;s spoiled his
dinner; and she&rsquo;s been in the nursery (pointing to the
youngest), and learned to do needlework well, as I can shew you
(producing a piece of work).&nbsp; There, ma&rsquo;am,
ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t that something like it should be?&nbsp; She
won&rsquo;t have to bargain for what she can&rsquo;t do,
that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There stood these two girls, looking rather pale and worn, but
by no means unhappy.&nbsp; They were very plainly, though neatly,
dressed; for no finery could have been afforded out of the small
wages which they had received.&nbsp; There was dignity about
them, arising from a feeling of conscious worth, and a sense that
they were not simply asking for employment as a favour: they were
prepared honourably and truthfully to give back in labour, the
value of what they received in board and wages.&nbsp; The
contract would be advantageous to both parties, proving that our
wise and kind Father has allowed and designed all these
distinctions for good; that, by mutual dependence, we may be led
to cherish those feelings of respect and regard for each other
which are the strongest cement of society.</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>&ldquo;For the body (of society) is not one member, but
many.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of
thee; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there should be no schism in the body; but that
the members should have the same care one for another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I need hardly say that places were easily found for such
girls.&nbsp; The gipsy-girl, too, has kept to her determination
of doing something well, and has been in one place for the last
fifteen months.</p>

class="smcap">Those</span> who have watched the
&ldquo;Mothers&rsquo; Society&rdquo; from the commencement, will
see that every year has been marked by steady progress; and not
merely in numbers: the moral and spiritual tone has deepened,
become more real, more earnest, more active.&nbsp; Nothing was so
distressing to me, when I first commenced this work, as to
observe the unkind feelings which these women manifested towards
each other.&nbsp; It was no unusual thing for me to receive a
call from one of them, for the purpose of telling me, that if I
allowed Mrs So-and-So to come to the meeting, then she should
<i>not</i> come.&nbsp; &ldquo;They hadn&rsquo;t spoke for months,
and never meant to speak any more; and there was no pleasure in
coming and seeing such a &lsquo;ippocrit&rsquo; as she was,
&lsquo;sitten up there.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, again, I was
warned not to take up with such a one; for she was as false as
she was high, and &ldquo;nobody never believed a word she
said.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once, a mother came to complain against her
own daughter, telling me she was quite undeserving of the
assistance I was rendering her, and that the only thing that
brought her amongst us was to get all <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>she could.&nbsp; I often spoke to
them very earnestly about these accusations of each other, and
assured them that this sin would be to our meetings what
Achan&rsquo;s crime was to the camp of Israel; that we could
neither expect the blessing of a God of love ourselves, nor hope
that our united prayers for our children would be heard and
answered, whilst we were hating instead of helping one
another.</p>
<p>But this is not so much a thing to be lectured against, as to
be lived down.&nbsp; The constant reading together of the Word of
God, especially of His life who so loved us, sinners though we
are, as to die for us, soon had its effect upon us.&nbsp; We have
always, from the first, made a point of referring in our prayers
to any particular family affliction which had occurred to any of
our number, and also of sending kind messages to the absent; and
as I persisted in doing this to saints and sinners alike, and
never took any further notice of the evil reports brought to me,
than to pray more earnestly than ever, that we might <i>all</i>
be delivered from the particular sins complained of, the evil
spirit seemed gradually to die out, and I hailed with joy many
evidences of a very <i>different</i> spirit.&nbsp; The elder
women began to remember that they could sometimes help the
younger ones, by nursing their babies, so that the work for the
many little ones at home might proceed the faster.&nbsp; The
younger members, in their turn, would stop to thread the needle,
which the failing sight of some companion made a difficult
operation.&nbsp; The warmest seat by the <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>fire was
given up to the poor invalid, who came with a bad cough, or to
the newly made mother, with her &ldquo;wee baby.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
only two footstools in the room were given up to those who most
needed them, instead of keeping them, with the remark, &ldquo;I
got it fust, and I shall keep it,&rdquo; which at one time might
have been heard.</p>
<p>One evening last winter I read to them, from &ldquo;The Book
and its Mission,&rdquo; some account of Marian, and what she was
doing for her poor neighbours in St Giles&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I saw
they were extremely interested in the narrative; and I said to
them&mdash;&ldquo;Now, many of you, I know, feel to those about
you as kindly as Marian; and if any of you think that you have
time, and strength, and spirit, for this work, I believe that,
without giving up your whole days to it (as, with you, that would
be impossible), you might, by a little planning and arrangement,
accomplish a great deal of good.&rdquo;&nbsp; After the meeting
was over, three of the women came to me, and offered their
services in any way I thought best.&nbsp; As it was then too late
to go into the subject, I invited them to tea on the following
Wednesday.&nbsp; The three came, bringing with them a fourth, the
mother of several little children, who apologised much for
coming, especially as she had to bring her baby with her.&nbsp;
She knew she couldn&rsquo;t do much, but she couldn&rsquo;t bear
to be left out.&nbsp; She thought she might take her baby, and
sit with a sick neighbour sometimes; or take care of some little
children, with her own, now and then, if that would do any
good.&nbsp; Two of the women were upwards <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>of fifty
years of age, and had then no children living with them; the
other was one of those who attended our first meeting, and then
told me, that she thought, if we went on with the society, she
might look in now and then upon us: not that she wanted to learn
anything; for, &ldquo;I &rsquo;spect,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I
know everything better than anybody can tell me.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
fact, that <i>her</i> visits would be to give us her
patronage.&nbsp; However, as we became better acquainted, we were
soon good friends.&nbsp; She lost her husband a few months
afterwards, and was left to struggle alone, with a family of
boys, to whom she has done her duty, and they are truly rising up
to call her blessed.&nbsp; With a very limited allowance from the
parish, she managed, by washing and mangling, to earn enough to
support them, and send them all to school; but the work was too
hard for her.&nbsp; After the first year or two, I began to
observe that she walked uneasily, and that the expression of her
countenance indicated constant suffering.&nbsp; I soon found that
she was suffering from an internal complaint, which, I feared, at
first, admitted of no remedy.&nbsp; But, notwithstanding all she
endured, she worked on, always saying she could bear anything but
the workhouse, and separation from her children; and managed, in
spite of such difficulties as would have sunk many a strong
man&rsquo;s heart, to keep her little home to herself, and retain
over her great boys an almost unbounded influence.&nbsp; She
became so very ill last summer, that I took her one day to
&ldquo;The London Home,&rdquo; a kind of hospital for chronic
diseases just <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>established in our neighbourhood.&nbsp; The doctors
spoke of her case, not only hopefully, but as one that could
certainly be cured; but it must be by an operation; and it would
be necessary for her to become an inmate of the hospital for four
or five weeks.&nbsp; Under the skilful and humane care of Mr
Baker Brown, the cause of her suffering was entirely removed; and
the gratitude of this poor woman for so great a mercy seemed
unbounded.&nbsp; During the evening on which she and her
companions came to my house, she said&mdash;&ldquo;After I was
sure I was going to be well again, I used to lie in my bed in
that hospital there for hours, with my heart lifted up with
gratitude to God; and I asked Him so many times to shew me what I
should do for Him for all His great love and kindness to
me.&nbsp; I really did feel that love and thankfulness to Him,
that I thought the first strength I had I <i>must</i> give to
Him; but I couldn&rsquo;t exactly see how.&nbsp; Last Monday was
the first time, since then, I have been able to come to the
meeting; and as you were reading about Marian, I says to myself,
&lsquo;There, that&rsquo;s your sort of work; that&rsquo;s what
you&rsquo;re to do;&rsquo; and I began to think how God had tried
me, and how I had suffered in almost every way, and that He had
helped me through everything, and never left me; and I knew then
that this was <i>His</i> way of teaching me, and preparing me to
help others.&nbsp; And now, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she went on to
say, &ldquo;you see, people is very kind to me; and my
children&rsquo;s beginning to help me; and I shan&rsquo;t have
quite so much hard work as I have had; and though I can&rsquo;t
do a great deal yet, I think I <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>could give up <i>two</i> afternoons
in the week for doing what I can for those who want help.&nbsp;
And I have thought of what you often have told us, too,
ma&rsquo;am, that if we will but make a beginning in what is
right&mdash;even if we don&rsquo;t see exactly how&mdash;that the
way will open to us as we go along, and God will send the light
as we want it.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t, none of us, feel very wise
about it at present; but we are all ready to do, as far as we
can, anything you think best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We spent a very pleasant evening together, and talked over
various plans.&nbsp; The women were of varied capacities, and I
saw that they were not all fitted for the same work; but they
were all actuated by the same spirit&mdash;love to their Saviour,
and willingness to work for Him.</p>
<p>At our next meeting, in the following week, just as I sat down
to read, a little girl entered the room, and, coming up to me,
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, ma&rsquo;am, mother sent me here to ask you to
pray for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with your mother?&rdquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is very bad, ma&rsquo;am, and hasn&rsquo;t got
nobody to do nothing for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the little girl was gone, I inquired if anybody knew this
person (Mrs S&mdash;), as she had only attended our meetings for
a few times.&nbsp; Only one woman present knew anything about
her, and she not much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that she is a poor
troubled thing, as has known better days, and likes to keep
herself <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>to herself, like; for her husband spends everything in
drink, and never leaves her anything to make herself decent
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said to them, &ldquo;I feel sure this poor woman wants just
the kind of help and sympathy that some of you know how to
give.&nbsp; I leave her in your hands, and you can let me know if
you want any help from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next afternoon, one of these newly appointed missionaries
called on me.&nbsp; She said she had just come from Mrs S&mdash;,
and described her visit as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really could hardly help crying, ma&rsquo;am, when I
first went in, and saw what a state the poor thing was in.&nbsp;
Her baby was born on Saturday afternoon; and because she was too
poor to pay the midwife the whole of the sum due to her, the
woman did not return to her the next morning, as they usually do,
to wash and dress the baby; but there she had been left, without
a creature going near to do anything for her.&nbsp; She was too
ill to do anything for the baby herself; and there they and the
other children had been crying for hours.&nbsp; I tried to speak
cheerfully to her, and told her I would soon set it all to
rights; so I made up her bed clean and comfortable, first, while
the water was heating, and then I got a great washing-pan and
washed the poor miserable little baby in it, and put on it some
clean things, which I found in the bag of baby-linen that had
been lent her.&nbsp; The little thing had been crying for hours;
but it soon felt comfortable, and went off to sleep before I had
finished dressing it.&nbsp; I put it into bed with its mother,
and then I got the Bible and <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>read a few verses to her; and then I
knelt down and prayed with her as well as I could.&nbsp; I asked
God to help her out of her trouble, and keep her from thinking
hard thoughts of Him, and make her to see He meant it for her
good.&nbsp; Then I talked to her a good bit; and she told me how
she had been well off once, but that her husband&rsquo;s drinking
had ruined them all.&nbsp; She cried very much, poor thing, and
said she had been praying all the morning that God would send
some one to help her.&nbsp; I tried to comfort her as well as I
could, and told her that we would all pray for her, and that God
could change her husband&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; Then I kissed her,
and so I came away: and now, ma&rsquo;am, I am come to you, if
you please, for some food for them; for they all want that badly
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning another of these self-constituted
missionaries went.&nbsp; She was not so gifted in many ways as
the one who first called.&nbsp; She had fewer words at command,
and her hands were stiff, having suffered from rheumatism, in
consequence of which she found it impossible to dress the baby;
so she went for the mother mentioned above, who wished to do
something to help; and took care of her children while she was
gone.&nbsp; After this she returned, carried away everything that
wanted washing, and brought it all back clean in the
evening.&nbsp; This she continued to do for three weeks: in fact,
these three kind women took the entire charge of the poor
sufferer, and watched over her till she was able to work
again.</p>
<p>I shall not easily forget the evening when Mrs S&mdash; <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>came
amongst us again, bringing the new baby, as they usually do, to
introduce to the meeting.&nbsp; The regular business had not
commenced, and I was going about from one to the other, taking
the money for the work.&nbsp; After congratulating her upon her
recovery, and welcoming the new baby, she passed on to a seat by
the fire, that some of them were trying to make extraordinarily
comfortable for her.&nbsp; I saw a little group gathering round
her, talking about the baby (we are rather in the habit of making
a good deal of the last baby); and presently, as in the course of
my work I passed near this group, I heard her say, &ldquo;You
have been just like kind sisters to me.&nbsp; It was the best day
of my life when I came here, and I shall never forget how kind
you have been to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Mrs S&mdash;,&rdquo; said a kind, cheerful woman, who
had the good sense to see that the expression of strong feeling
was too much for the poor, weak mother just then, &ldquo;never
you mind about that; it did us good to do it: and you must make
haste and get well and strong, and then we shall come upon you to
help us some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sequel to this story is too pleasant to be omitted.</p>
<p>During the Christmas week, or as soon as possible afterwards,
we invite the poor women of this society, with their husbands, to
partake of a social cup of tea together.&nbsp; The nicely lighted
and prettily decorated rooms presented last year a most cheerful
appearance.&nbsp; About a hundred and fifty of these poor people
assembled, with fifty or sixty of their richer neighbours.</p>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>That
evening I saw, for the first time, the husband of Mrs
S&mdash;.&nbsp; They were sitting together, and she was nursing
her baby; but they both looked uneasy.&nbsp; The drunkard and his
family are so accustomed to &ldquo;hide themselves away from
view,&rdquo; that the bright light and numerous company made them
feel how shabby they were.&nbsp; A few kind, encouraging words
were at first necessary to reassure them, and make them feel that
they were welcome.&nbsp; Presently, I had the pleasure of
observing that they had become thoroughly interested in what was
passing, and the clouds had passed away from their
countenances.</p>
<p>I do not think that any exhortation was given that night to
drunkards especially,&mdash;in fact, I believe that the subject
was never once mentioned in any way.&nbsp; The platform was
occupied by gentlemen of no common standing.&nbsp; Amongst the
speakers, were some of the leading philanthropists of the day;
and it is not matter of surprise that the words of these earnest
men should have conveyed to their audience something of the
intense love and sympathy which pervaded their own hearts.&nbsp;
It was an evening that many will long remember with pleasure; but
to our poor friend (Mrs S&mdash;) it was the beginning of a new
life.&nbsp; After the meeting was over, her husband said to
her&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wife, I am done for; I can never go back to those
drinking ways again.&nbsp; I can stand up against a good deal;
but those people there would have moved a post, let alone a
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This man was a fishmonger, and once had a business <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>in this
trade which he sold for &pound;300.&nbsp; The greater part of
this money was squandered in drink.&nbsp; Since then, the only
means by which he could support himself and his family had been
by hawking fish about the streets.&nbsp; For many hours of a
Sunday morning, his loud voice might have been heard resounding
through the streets and squares of the neighbourhood; even the
church doors were not thick enough to shut out the noise; and the
annoyance was often the subject of complaint.</p>
<p>I went to see them, one morning about the beginning of March,
but not in the damp cellar where our acquaintance was first
made.&nbsp; They had taken a neat little shop, and, though it was
not well stocked, they were getting on.</p>
<p>The eldest girl, who was appointed to look after the shop,
certainly looked as if she felt herself &ldquo;a person of
consequence.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could scarcely recognise in her the
poor &ldquo;crushed-out&rdquo; thing whom I had seen working for
the family in their former dark abode.&nbsp; The other
children&mdash;who used to remind me of the plants which we shut
up in our cellars in the winter, keeping them without nourishment
or light, that they may not exhaust their powers in
growing&mdash;were now gambolling about the shop, while the sun
was shining on them so brightly that they had to shade their eyes
with their hands as they looked up.&nbsp; The mother, though she
had lost that look of abject distress, still seemed anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hard work, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;to get right <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>when things have been going wrong so
long; but I hope, by God&rsquo;s blessing, we shall get out of
trouble after a bit; for my husband keeps steady, thank
God.&nbsp; The children go to school now, and the elder ones have
joined the Band of Hope.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think anything in
the world would make these two boys drink.&nbsp; They go errands
sometimes for people, and have drink offered to them, but they
will never touch it.&nbsp; I do pray every day that they may
never know what it is to suffer and sin as we have
done.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>And so the poor mother, with the full consciousness before her
of the cause of her own blighted life, looks at her children, and
with uplifted hands and streaming eyes prays&mdash;as none but
the wife of a drunkard ever prays&mdash;&ldquo;Deliver them, oh,
deliver them from evil!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the children, with the
recollection ever before them of their joyless childhood and
sorrowful home, band themselves together, trying thus by union to
strengthen their moral courage to resist evil, and they
pray&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, lead us not into temptation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Let us kneel with them and pray too, that God, in mercy to these
poor captives, sighing for deliverance, will awaken the
consciences of those who still dare to offer the intoxicating cup
as a remuneration for labour.&nbsp; If they will not pause and
listen to the groans of humanity, the wail of despair, that is
ascending night and day from every corner of this land through
this accursed thing, let them, for their own sakes, ponder the
meaning of the terrible words too lightly passed <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>over, even
by those who tell us that He who uttered them is their Lord and
Master.&nbsp; &ldquo;Woe to that man by whom the offence
cometh!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It were better for him that a
millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea,
than that he should offend one of these little ones.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>But to return to our missionaries.&nbsp; One of them spends
the greater part of Monday morning in collecting money for the
savings&rsquo; bank.&nbsp; She has occasionally brought me as
much as &pound;2 in the evening, all obtained in small sums, even
as low as a penny, and rarely higher than 2s. 6d.&nbsp; This poor
woman suffers very much from a swollen foot and leg.&nbsp; I have
said to her&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you must find it very painful to walk and
stand about so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, &rsquo;tis rather,&rdquo; she will
say; &ldquo;but it does me good: and I think how happy I shall be
when I take it back to them in the winter, and they tell me it is
all as if I had given it to them, for they haven&rsquo;t a-missed
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday afternoon, they bring me their report of what they
have been doing during the week.&nbsp; I learn from them the
general state of things, and what is actually transpiring, much
better than I could from any investigation of my own
making.&nbsp; The poor have no hope, in their dealings with one
another, of getting at a &ldquo;blind side,&rdquo; as they
sometimes do with a lady; and the positive facts which I obtain
are of great use <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>to me in many ways, and have often saved me from making
mistakes.</p>
<p>In order to keep up a vigorous and lively interest at the
&ldquo;Mothers&rsquo; Meetings,&rdquo; the subjects that are
brought forward must usually have some reference to what is
passing among them.&nbsp; I have frequently, at home, thought of
a topic to form the basis of our conversation in the evening; and
on my way there, or even after I have entered the room, I have
heard of events which I knew must so absorb their attention, that
there could be little chance of their following out my train of
thought; and that if I wished to do them good, I must follow
theirs instead.</p>
<p>I once heard our city missionary make a remark, which has been
very useful to me.&nbsp; He said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must remember, in our intercourse with the poor,
that they have a constant pressure upon their minds, as to how
they are to provide for their ever-returning wants; and we must
not expect more abstract attention from them than we feel we
should be inclined to give ourselves, supposing that we were so
situated as not to know certainly how the dinner for to-morrow
was to be provided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have thought that our interviews may be compared to meeting
men on a battle-field.&nbsp; How absurd it would be to call them
aside, and endeavour to fix their attention on some of the
abstruse metaphysical questions of the day!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; they would say, &ldquo;pray do not trifle with
us; we are ready to sink under the heat and burden of this
protracted contest!&nbsp; Talk to <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>us of the battle, and how we are to
sustain this conflict; and tell us, oh! tell us, is there any
hope of peace at last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>None, I believe, feel more emphatically that life is a battle
than the poor mother, with her many children and few helps.&nbsp;
The demands made on her strength, patience, and resources are
beyond what those in easier circumstances can conceive.&nbsp; I
have felt ashamed sometimes, after speaking of the virtues of
patience and forbearance, to think how utterly I might fail in
all these, were I tried as they are tried.</p>
<p>I once persuaded a poor man to attend a place of
worship.&nbsp; He went to a dissenting chapel.&nbsp; The next
time I saw him, I asked him how he liked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I dare say it
was all very good, if anybody could have understood it.&nbsp; I
thought I should have got on a bit with the prayer; but there
were such a lot of hard words in it, I couldn&rsquo;t make
nothing of it.&nbsp; Parsons don&rsquo;t understand nothing about
us, or, instead of praying for all them outlandish things,
they&rsquo;d pray a bit for us, now and then, and for our poor
wives at home, that can&rsquo;t never get out to pray for
themselves, and got work to do that would frighten them to look
at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark will shew the estimation in which the very poor
generally hold the services in our churches and chapels.&nbsp; It
would be unwise to argue from it, that some great alteration must
be necessary; that the language and thoughts of every preacher
should be so simplified as to be brought to the level of the <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>uneducated.&nbsp; There would be a want of justice in
this.&nbsp; The higher classes have a right to be considered, as
well as the poorer; their tastes and requirements must be thought
of and provided for; and as they are satisfied, edified, and
instructed by things as they are, for themselves, let things
remain as they are.&nbsp; What we want is something in
<i>addition</i> to that which we already have, and, we think,
something very different.</p>
<p>The college education received by our ministers of religion
would not be the best possible preparation for our Ragged School
Teachers and City Missionaries.&nbsp; The clearness imparted to
the intellect by mathematical studies, the extensive knowledge of
words derived from the acquirement of many languages,&mdash;in
fact, the general discipline through which the mind of the
student passes, gives him a mental power which sets him at an
immeasurable distance from the man who does all his counting upon
his fingers, and whose only knowledge of language is derived from
what he has picked up in the streets.</p>
<p>Our City Missionaries are doing what they can to supply this
want.&nbsp; The hired room where they sit, surrounded by the
unwashed and uncombed, picturing out to them a passage of
Scripture, applying its lessons to their daily life, and then
praying to Him who can bless their daily toil, and give them
daily strength,&mdash;these are the services appreciated by the
&ldquo;sons of toil,&rdquo; and we thank God for having raised up
these simple, earnest teachers.</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>It is
the deep conviction which I hold that the poor can be best
helped, as well as taught, by those who thoroughly understand
them, that has induced me to hail with delight the introduction
upon the field of labour of the Female Missionary.&nbsp; A
sensible, true-hearted Christian woman, very little removed above
the poor herself, will accomplish much more amongst them than any
lady, however well inclined she may be.&nbsp; So many
minuti&aelig; must be considered in endeavouring to improve the
home habits of these people, such a constant watchfulness is
necessary to prevent a degeneration into merely amateur work,
that it requires all the method, skill, and determination of the
professional hand.</p>
<p>There are modes of argument which the poor know how to use
with the poor, which would never occur to people differently
situated.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, I requested one of our
missionaries to call upon a family, where there were a number of
children growing up in great ignorance, and to see if she could
not persuade the mother to send some of them to school.&nbsp;
Next time I saw her, I asked her what success she had had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t get on at all; the mother did not seem to care
about the children&rsquo;s knowing anything, and she said she was
sure she could not afford the school-money.&nbsp; I told her I
found it was always a saving in the end; for their shoes
didn&rsquo;t get worn out so fast, nor their clothes torn, and I
hadn&rsquo;t a-near so much washing to do for &rsquo;em, as if
they did run in the streets.&nbsp; I told her, it often cost <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>me more in
the holidays for mending their shoes than as though I had paid
the school-money.&nbsp; She took up with this directly, and said,
if that was it, she&rsquo;d send the most rackety of &rsquo;em;
and if it answered, she&rsquo;d send the rest after a
bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, it is just possible that it might have occurred to a lady
to use this same kind of argument; but would have lost its force
with the mother, because she would have known it was not the
result of actual experience.</p>
<p>We hope, if spared to another winter, and if we are fortunate
enough to obtain the requisite funds, that we shall be able to
establish a paid missionary in the Potteries.&nbsp; Great as the
improvement has been, much still remains to be effected.&nbsp;
This poor place, that was left so many years <i>literally</i>
wallowing in the mire, is still much behind-hand in cleanliness
and home comfort.&nbsp; The keen eye, the ready hand, and the
loving heart of some good Christian woman, who can devote the
whole of her time to the work, is just what we want.&nbsp; We
must trust in Him, who has already done so much for us, that He
will open the way as we go on, and raise up for us, in our time
of need, both the person and the pay.</p>

<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>I
<span class="GutSmall">MENTIONED</span> in the last chapter that
I had often seen the necessity of deferring a subject previously
prepared for the evening of our meeting, and adopting, in its
stead, a topic more appropriate to passing events.&nbsp; As I
consider this point of much importance, I am glad that my journal
can furnish an illustration.</p>
<p>One evening, in the year 1854, as we were putting aside our
work, one of the women reminded me that the day of our next
meeting would be a fast-day; and she asked if we were to assemble
as usual.&nbsp; I replied, &ldquo;That as that day would be set
aside for a special purpose, and one in which we were all deeply
interested, I thought it would be better for us to make a point
of all attending some place of worship, and uniting with others
in our prayers for the deliverance of our country from the great
evils which threatened it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two or three voices exclaimed at once&mdash;&ldquo;Then, if
that is it, we shan&rsquo;t go nowhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
not?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>One of them replied&mdash;&ldquo;My master never lets me go <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>to any
place.&nbsp; We have neither of us ever been inside a church
since we were married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two or three of the others said that was just the case with
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it, then, that your husbands let you come
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am, we goes on with our work here; and it
helps us to get many a nice bit of clothes, that we should have
to go without if we didn&rsquo;t get them here, by paying a
little at a time; and the children, too, you see, ma&rsquo;am, is
mostly in bed before we come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not think that some of you could persuade your
husbands to go to church with you, for once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook their heads, and said they were afraid not.&nbsp;
There were a few in the room who said they would go, if they
could.&nbsp; I told them, if they would express to me what their
wishes were, I would adopt any plan they liked best.&nbsp; With
the exception of about six or eight, they said they would rather
the meeting were continued as usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is the case,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I will be
here at the usual time next week, to meet any of you who cannot
make it convenient to attend any place of worship; but remember,
we must have no work done.&nbsp; I should not think that right on
such a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I entered the room the following week, I found thirty of
the poor mothers assembled.&nbsp; We sat and chatted together for
about a quarter of an hour; for we felt, on that occasion, that
we were not bound to observe our rules with our usual
strictness.&nbsp; I intended <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>to read about our Saviour&rsquo;s
entrance into Jerusalem, and to dwell particularly on the tears
He shed in the prospect of the destruction of that city, shewing
from this how unwillingly God allowed His judgments to descend
upon a nation, and that &ldquo;He would rather they would turn
from their wickedness and live.&rdquo;&nbsp; The rest of the
evening I thought we could occupy in the relation of a few
anecdotes of soldiers, that had reached me from the seat of
war.&nbsp; I had just begun to read, when the door opened, and a
woman, passing hastily up the room, took her seat on a low box by
the side of the fire.&nbsp; She leaned forward, resting her head
on her arms, and began to weep bitterly.&nbsp; I looked up for an
explanation.&nbsp; One of the women said, &ldquo;She lost her
baby, ma&rsquo;am, a day or two ago, and she takes on terribly
about it.&rdquo;&nbsp; We all sat silently for some minutes, for
we felt the sacredness of the presence of grief; they were
precious minutes to me, full of earnest thought and feeling.</p>
<p>About ten months previous to the time of which I am speaking,
this woman first came amongst us, bringing her baby, then about
six weeks old.&nbsp; I thought I had scarcely ever seen so sweet
a child; the expression of the little face reminded me of
something holier and purer than is usually to be met with in this
fallen world; and I did not wonder that it was said, &ldquo;Of
<i>such</i> are the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; I knew both
the father and the mother.&nbsp; The father was a genius of no
common order, and, but for the fatal habit of drinking, would
have risen in the world.&nbsp; The mother had known <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>better
days, and not having much spirit, she had too easily resigned
herself to her fate, and scarcely exerted herself as much as she
might have done, to avert the evils that surrounded her;
consequently their home was an unhappy one.</p>
<p>On the first evening of the introduction of these little ones,
we are in the habit of commending them in prayer to the especial
care and protection of our heavenly Father.&nbsp; I am afraid the
prayer that night was not mixed with faith, as it ought to have
been.&nbsp; I remember thinking of the home in which this child
was to be trained, and of all the evil influences to which he
must be exposed; and I wondered <i>how</i> he was to be
&ldquo;led straight through this world of sin, and get to heaven
at last.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought of him &ldquo;tossed on the
tumultuous sea of human passions and temptations, without any
strong, kind hand to guide the helm;&rdquo; and I could have
wept, as I prayed that he might be shielded from life&rsquo;s
bitter trials and temptations.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I long&rsquo;d for that happy and glorious
time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fairest, and brightest, and best,<br />
When the dear little children of every clime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall come to His arms and be blest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could not sleep that night without again committing this
sweet child in prayer to Him who &ldquo;carries the lambs in His
bosom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This mother and baby were so constant in their attendance,
that we should have suspected something wrong if they had not
made their appearance.&nbsp; As the <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>baby grew, he became still more
lovely; he smiled sweetly when he was noticed, and we all loved
him so much, that he was universally called &ldquo;<i>our</i>
baby.&rdquo;&nbsp; I occasionally took him on my lap when I was
reading, that the mother might get on the faster with her
work.&nbsp; He used to sit quietly, making playthings of my
fingers, or looking intently into my face, that he might be ready
with his sweet smile when he was noticed.</p>
<p>And it was for the loss of &ldquo;our baby&rdquo; that the
poor mother&rsquo;s tears were flowing so fast.&nbsp; No wonder
that many hearts there sympathised in her grief; and thoughts,
too deep for words, kept us silent.&nbsp; The mother was the
first to speak; she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, do you remember the first evening I
brought him here?&nbsp; You looked at him so, and said he was a
pictur&rsquo; child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I was just thinking of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We liked that name for him so much, it made his father
think more of him; he would watch him asleep in the cradle, and
say, &lsquo;Well, that is a pictur&rsquo; child, if ever there
was one.&rsquo;&nbsp; I never had nothing so good belonging to me
before, and I never shall again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember a little while ago,&rdquo; I remarked
in reply, &ldquo;when the weather was so cold, telling me you
feared the baby suffered for want of warmer clothes than you were
able to procure for him, and that the coarse food, which was all
you could get, did not agree with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I mind; he made me feel how bad it was to be
poor.&nbsp; I never cared about it so much before.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>&ldquo;Supposing I had promised to take the baby into
my house, and surround him with every comfort, and care for him
as for one of my own children, would you have given him up to
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;yes&mdash;I think I should, if I could have
seen him very often; for nothing troubled me so much as to see
him suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had taken him you would still have had to see him
suffer; for though I might have made him more comfortable than
you could, I could not have shielded him from the attacks of
disease and death, But he is gone now to a home where he will
never suffer any more.&nbsp; The kind hand of his heavenly Father
has wiped away the tears that distressed you so much.&nbsp; As
the Scotch song says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nae sorrow there,
Jean;<br />
There&rsquo;s neither cauld nor care, Jean;<br />
The day is aye fair, Jean,<br />
In the land o&rsquo; the leal.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as the mother could speak again for her tears, she
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think, ma&rsquo;am, he is gone there <i>for
certain</i>? &rsquo;cause some of &rsquo;em have been saying
to-day that nobody goes to heaven, not even babes, except they
are &rsquo;lected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite true; but when Jesus died upon the cross,
He did intend all infants to be saved.&nbsp; He there atoned for
the sin we inherit from our first parents, which is the only sin
with which an infant can be charged, as no one can be said to
break commandments <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>until they understand what commandments are.&nbsp; No
one has so much cause to love the Saviour as mothers of little
children.&nbsp; Ages before our children were born, their safety
was provided for by the death of Christ.&nbsp; When you go home,
I should like you to take your Bible, and read the account of our
Saviour&rsquo;s crucifixion; and as you are reading, just
think&mdash;&lsquo;Now all this suffering was to save <i>my
baby</i>, amongst many others.&rsquo;&nbsp; God has told us that
He is <i>satisfied</i> with the price Christ has paid for sin;
therefore, of course, there can be nothing else wanted.&nbsp; And
just think of this for a moment&mdash;God has given up <i>His
Son</i> to <i>suffer</i> for us, that we may give Him back our
children to be <i>happy for ever</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O ma&rsquo;am, I am so happy to hear about it!&nbsp;
You have made it clearer to my mind than it ever was
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to make it clear to you, also, that this
Saviour, of whom we are speaking, must be your Saviour, as well
as the Saviour of your child; for there is none other name given
among men whereby any of us can be saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, ma&rsquo;am, you don&rsquo;t mean that
Christ&rsquo;s dying has made it certain that we shall all get to
heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s death was intended, and is sufficient in
itself, to make all safe for heaven; but there are many who will
not accept this salvation.&nbsp; Supposing, now that provisions
are so high, I were to send to every man, woman, and child in the
Potteries, and say, that every day at one o&rsquo;clock I would
have a good dinner <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>provided for them at my house: I would take care there
should be room and abundance <i>for all</i>.&nbsp; It is said,
there are a thousand inhabitants in the Potteries.&nbsp;
Supposing, out of this number, only two hundred came.&nbsp; Some
might be too proud to accept my kindness; others, too busy in
seeking food in other ways.&nbsp; But the most extraordinary
thing of all would be, that some should have forgotten all about
it.&nbsp; They would go on eating the most miserable food,
suffering in every way in consequence, and grumbling at their
unhappy fate; while, if they would only come to me, I would
receive them, and give them abundance of the best.&nbsp;
Complaints might still reach my ears, how greatly the people were
suffering; but I should say&mdash;&lsquo;I really cannot help it;
I have done all I possibly can to prevent it.&nbsp; It grieves me
very much to see so many vacant places at my table&mdash;to see
bread enough, and to <i>spare</i>, whilst they perish with
hunger.&nbsp; I wish they would come to me, instead of suffering
as they do.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, this is just how it stands between
us and God.&nbsp; He wishes all men to be saved, and to come to
the knowledge of the truth.&nbsp; It is not the will of our
Father, who is in heaven, that <i>one</i> should perish.&nbsp; He
has provided, by the death of Christ, for the salvation of every
one; and none that come unto Him will He cast out.&nbsp; But we
must <i>come</i>.&nbsp; Just as certainly as those poor people
would lose the benefit of my dinner if they did not come, so
shall we lose the benefit of the great salvation provided, if we
do not come.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>All
present seemed much interested in this conversation, and several
began to ask me questions.&nbsp; One woman told me that some
ladies had called at her house some time ago, and inquired
particularly if her children had been baptized; telling her, that
if they had not, they had no chance of being saved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be true, can it, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were, it would, indeed, be a lamentable fact; for
how many children there are who are born and die, without the
possibility of being baptized.&nbsp; This often happens at sea,
for instance; and sometimes, especially in the country, where the
distances are great, it is not unusual for an infant to die
before there is time to obtain any minister of religion to
administer the ordinance.&nbsp; How very imperfect would be the
salvation which God has provided for us, if our reception of it
was made at all to depend upon circumstances that we could not
always control!&nbsp; Think for a moment, again, of the
comparison I was using just now.&nbsp; Supposing, when I sent out
my invitation for the people to come and dine at my house, I
should say, &lsquo;Though you may come, I cannot admit you inside
the house, unless you bring a card of admission with
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; I should mention where these cards could be
procured; but when applying for it, you might find that the
person, whose business it was to provide them, was ill, or not at
home, or something might prevent his attending to you till it was
too late; and, consequently, you must lose the benefit of my
dinner.&nbsp; You would say, and justly, &lsquo;Why, she is
deceiving us in professing to provide for <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>our
wants.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is of no use the dinner being there, if
there are obstacles which we cannot remove in the way of getting
at it.&nbsp; And God would have deceived us, too, in
saying&mdash;&lsquo;The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from
<i>all</i> sin,&rsquo; if there were still something left for us
to do.&nbsp; And Christ hath deceived us in saying on the
cross&mdash;&lsquo;It is <i>finished</i>,&rsquo; when all the
time He knew, that if we were not baptized by an ordained
minister of religion, all that He had done and suffered for us
would be worth nothing.&nbsp; There are few errors at which I
feel so indignant as this.&nbsp; It is so dishonouring to our
heavenly Father, and it is such a reflection both upon the wisdom
and justice of Him whose work is perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, ma&rsquo;am, isn&rsquo;t it any consequence
whether children are baptized or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you asked me that question; for I should have
been sorry for you to have gone away with the idea that it was of
no consequence.&nbsp; Do any of you know what circumcision
means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one knew; it was simply a <i>word</i> in their minds,
unconnected with any ideas.&nbsp; At last, one woman said she
thought it was something that the Jews did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was talking to you about Abraham, a little while
ago, do you remember my telling you that God had called him away
out of an idolatrous country; because He intended, from Abraham
and his children, to raise up a nation, in which the knowledge of
Himself should be preserved?&nbsp; God then commanded Abraham,
that he and all his children&mdash;meaning all the Jewish
nation&mdash;should be circumcised; intending, by <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>setting
this mark upon them, to shew that they were a distinct people,
and not intended to mix with any other nations of the
world.&nbsp; From that time, until the advent of our Saviour,
every male child amongst the Jews was circumcised on the eighth
day after its birth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the resurrection of our Saviour, He commanded His
apostles to go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
creature.&nbsp; It was no longer to be confined to this one
nation.&nbsp; Christ had died for <i>all</i>, not for the Jews
only: and all must hear this good news.&nbsp; Circumcision was a
painful rite; and as Christ had suffered for us, He no longer
enjoined this upon His followers: in its stead, the simple,
beautiful, and expressive ordinance of baptism was instituted;
and all who call themselves Christians should thankfully use it,
as making a line of separation, as it were, between them and the
heathen world, as the Jews used circumcision to distinguish
themselves from the idolatrous nations by which they were
surrounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When, therefore, we take our infants to be baptized, it
is as if we said&mdash;&lsquo;I call the Church and the world to
witness that I desire for my child that he may be brought up in
the faith and practice of a Christian.&nbsp; I beseech you, that
are here assembled, to unite with me in prayer to Almighty God,
that, through the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, He will grant
to this child that thing which by nature he cannot have; that he
may be baptized with water and the Holy Ghost, and received into
Christ&rsquo;s holy <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>Church; and that I may have grace
given me so to train my child that he may be a blessing to the
world as long as he lives, and, finally, through the
righteousness provided by the death and sufferings of our blessed
Saviour, may come to the land of everlasting life and happiness,
and dwell in His bright presence for ever.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This explanation, although it was broken up and illustrated in
a way that it would be tedious to repeat here, was not perfectly
intelligible to them at first; but as they asked questions about
it, a clearer light seemed gradually to dawn upon their
minds.&nbsp; One woman said she &ldquo;always had a-done it, but
never had no <i>thought</i> in her mind about it
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We concluded the evening by reading of the little children who
were brought to Jesus; and then, in united prayer, we commended
the sorrowing mother to Him who came to comfort Martha and Mary
concerning their brother.&nbsp; We thanked Him for the loan,
though so short, of this sweet and lovely child, whose mission on
earth seemed to have been to awaken in its mother a purer and
holier nature.&nbsp; And we thanked Him, too, that &ldquo;ere sin
could blight, or sorrow fade,&rdquo; the Good Shepherd, who had
laid down His life for this lamb of the flock, had resumed the
care of this precious one, had spared him the contest of life,
and taken him to Himself, to be safe and happy for ever.</p>
<p>I always feel tempted, when reviewing my journal, to linger
over the narrative of the &ldquo;Fast-day evening.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
recall how we sat and talked till the daylight had <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>faded into
twilight, and then we watched the fire as its flickering blaze
occasionally rested on the placid face of some infant sleeping on
its mother&rsquo;s lap.&nbsp; I recall, as if it were but
yesterday, the earnest and fixed attention, with which this
company of mothers listened to the glad tidings of a Saviour for
their little ones.&nbsp; Had He been presented to us as
<i>our</i> Saviour only, we must have loved Him; but how much
more when we realised that, at such infinite cost, He had
stretched forth His hand to save those dearer to us than life,
from everlasting destruction!</p>
<p>Some of the women that were there still speak of this evening
with pleasure; and there was joy in the presence of the angels of
God, that night, over more than one sinner that repented.</p>
<p>I have occasionally taken much pains to make the
<i>doctrines</i> of religion somewhat clear to them.&nbsp; It
might not in every case be so necessary; but in this
neighbourhood, where the enemy is more than usually busy in
&ldquo;sowing tares,&rdquo; it is of great importance that they
should be enabled to give a reason for the hope that is in
them.</p>
<p>The vicinity of Notting Hill has, unfortunately, been selected
by the Roman Catholics as the scene of their most active
operations.&nbsp; Whilst I write, I hear from my open window the
sound of &ldquo;busy workmen&rdquo; employed on the rising walls
of a nunnery of great size and importance.&nbsp; They have just
purchased a piece of land in Pottery Lane, once the celebrated
Cut-throat Lane, on which they intend building
school-rooms.&nbsp; <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>Only a few days ago, I was told that
a poor woman had called, seeking relief.&nbsp; On finding she was
a stranger to me, and being already overdone with similar cases,
I sent a message by the servant, that I was truly sorry for her,
but it was not then in my power to attend to her case.&nbsp; Her
reply to the servant was, &ldquo;Ah! the Roman Catholics is
coming amongst us, and they&rsquo;ll never stand by and see us
poor people suffer, like you Protestants do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever distinctions may prevail in the various sections
among Protestants, we surely all agree in this, that we are
looking for salvation simply and entirely through the merits of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Compared with <i>this</i>, the points on which we differ are
few and unimportant, affecting principally what we may call our
outside life&mdash;belonging to the &ldquo;wood, hay,
stubble&rdquo; that attaches to the present imperfect state of
things, and, if not at last burnt with fire, will, at least, be
lost sight of, when, instead of seeing through a glass darkly,
the mind grasps the astonishing and overwhelming meaning of being
<i>saved to the uttermost</i>.</p>
<p>A voice from the enemy&rsquo;s camp has reached us, that their
great hopes of success rest upon the disunion amongst the ranks
of Protestants.&nbsp; God grant that these hopes may be
disappointed!&nbsp; In times of national calamity, when homes and
hearths are threatened by the invasion of a foreign foe, the
people are exhorted to let no private consideration, no respect
for <a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>individual property, <i>nothing</i>, in fact, prevent
their rising as with the heart of one man, to fight manfully for
the defence of their king and their country.&nbsp; Let us, it
would be said, only expel this common foe, and mere personal
matters can be arranged afterwards.</p>
<p>And now that the foe is bearing down with such a threatening
aspect upon the interests of our Master&rsquo;s kingdom, is it
still to be said&mdash;&ldquo;The children of this world are
wiser in their generation than the children of
light?&rdquo;&nbsp; Is it too much to expect that we should work
for Him, who <i>died</i> for us?</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Speak kindly, speak kindly; ye know not the
power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of a soft and gentle word,<br />
As its tones, in a sad and troubled hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the weary heart are heard.<br />
Ye know not how often it comes to bless<br />
The stranger amid his weariness;<br />
How many a blessing is round thee thrown<br />
By the magic spell of a soft low tone.<br />
Speak kindly, then, kindly; there&rsquo;s nothing lost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By gentle words&mdash;to the heart and ear<br />
Of the sad and lonely they&rsquo;re dear, how dear!&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they nothing cost.&rdquo;</p>

class="smcap">However</span> desirous any President of a
Mothers&rsquo; Society may be of being constantly at her post, it
must be obvious to all that occasional absence cannot be
avoided.&nbsp; No assumed duties, however important, must for a
moment supersede the first claims of home and kindred.&nbsp; Some
have thought that the one must necessarily interfere with the
other, and, consequently, both ought not to be attempted; but
experience proves that the faculties, from daily use, become
rather brightened than worn, and can accomplish more than when
merely called up on especial occasions.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;much&rdquo; will be entrusted to those who are faithful in
that which is least, and not to those who stand all the day
idle.&nbsp; The Master for whom we work does not employ us as the
Egyptians did the Israelites, demanding the tale of bricks, and
yet saying&mdash;&ldquo;Let them go and gather straw for
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We acknowledge the hand of God perhaps less in the supply of
our mental, than in either our temporal or spiritual, wants, and
this often makes us unwilling to attempt work to which, in the
prospect, we feel ourselves <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>unequal.&nbsp; Who does not know the
fear and trembling with which new undertakings are usually
commenced; like Mary going to the sepulchre, we think only of the
stone at the entrance, and say, Who shall roll it away?</p>
<p>I once heard a lady say that, to accommodate a friend, she had
promised to undertake the management of a Bible class for a few
weeks; but as the time for its commencement drew on, she found
herself so completely unnerved by her anxious fears and distrust
of herself, that she was obliged to send a message to say she
could not possibly meet the class.&nbsp; She has since learnt a
different kind of preparation; and were she again placed in
similar circumstances, she would go, as we all must, like
Solomon, to the fountain of wisdom, and say&mdash;&ldquo;I am but
a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.&nbsp; Give
therefore thy servant an understanding heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not necessary to have confidence in ourselves before we
begin important work, especially work through which we hope to
influence others; but the poor mind, conscious of innumerable
weaknesses and defects, must stay itself somewhere; it cannot
carry its burden alone without fainting under the load.&nbsp; Our
heavenly Father knows this, and says to us&mdash;&ldquo;Do not
try to carry it.&nbsp; Cast thy burden upon me; I will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify me.&rdquo;&nbsp; How well that it
should be so!&nbsp; This at once places both us and our work in
the right position&mdash;glorify me, not ourselves.&nbsp; We do
not praise the tool that has chiseled <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>out the beautiful sculpture, but the
hand that has wielded and directed that instrument.</p>
<p>I remember one evening, when entering the room where our
meeting was held, feeling immediately conscious that something
not quite pleasant was going on there.&nbsp; One of our members,
a fine tall woman, was standing at the work-table, with her great
baby, about six months old, in her arms.&nbsp; She was speaking
in a loud angry tone, and as I approached the table I heard her
say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s of no use, it&rsquo;ll never fit my baby;
and so I tell ye I shan&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lady,
who that evening kindly superintended the cutting-out of the
work, appealed to me, and said that the dimensions of the article
had really been carefully attended to, and was the same in every
respect as those generally received by the mothers with great
satisfaction, I saw directly that this case differed from most
contests, where both parties are usually wrong, for here both
were right; the uncommon size of the baby accounted for it
all.&nbsp; So turning to it I said, &ldquo;Ah! baby, I wonder you
are not ashamed of yourself to be so big, and thus to cause such
a disturbance here; there&rsquo;s no getting anything to fit
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I said to the mother, &ldquo;You should
have observed that this article you have rejected is the usual
size; but if you will let your baby be as big at six months as he
ought to be at twelve, you must just take the consequences.&nbsp;
I will give you some material that you must cut out for yourself,
and try to fit your great boy if you can.&rdquo;&nbsp; The baby
crowed and laughed, and seemed delighted at being such an object
of attention; <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>the mother caught the infection, and laughed too,
acknowledged her mistake, apologised to the lady, and walked off
to her seat, by no means displeased at being convicted of having
one of the finest babies in the world.</p>
<p>A friend of mine happened to be there that evening who was
wishing to establish a similar society in her own neighbourhood,
and had come to look on upon us.&nbsp; As we were walking home
together she said, &ldquo;I see how it is you are so successful,
you have so much tact.&nbsp; I wonder how you can meet all these
cases as they turn up.&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied, &ldquo;I should
wonder very much if I could not.&nbsp; I never go there without
asking direction from Him who is &lsquo;the giver of every good
and perfect gift;&rsquo; and He who has said, &lsquo;Ask and ye
shall receive,&rsquo; simply keeps His promise, and gives me the
wisdom I petition for.&nbsp; Whatever difficulties arise, I
remember that the Lord God of Elijah, of Solomon, and of David,
is my God, and He is as willing to make me wise to govern a
society, as He was them to govern kingdoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In stepping aside for an instant just to shew that, with this
help, within the reach of all, we may become wise enough to do
something for our poor neighbours, and yet in no way be unmindful
of our domestic claims, I have wandered away from my starting
point, which referred to the necessity of occasional absence from
home.</p>
<p>The influence I have obtained over some of these poor people,
and the respect and affection with which they have so abundantly
rewarded any little kindness they <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>may have received, I regard in the
light of a sacred trust, for which I am accountable, and which I
am under no circumstances at liberty to set on one side, and
treat as though it did not exist.&nbsp; During these seasons of
absence, therefore, by way of keeping up my acquaintance, I
frequently address to some of them little friendly notes,
generally expressing an interest in some passing event with which
they may be connected, or perhaps simply a few words of sympathy
to some poor sufferer &ldquo;stricken of God and
afflicted.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor are quite aware that this is a
kind of attention that one lady might shew to another, and there
are few things they appreciate so highly.&nbsp; A note that has
perhaps scarcely taken ten minutes to write, and whose only cost
has been the paper, envelope, and stamp, has won many a heart,
and cleared the way for further improvement.</p>
<p>But it will be obvious that, in a society numbering now ninety
members, it is not possible to give this individual attention to
all.&nbsp; That none may feel themselves forgotten and neglected,
I usually send one letter addressed to all the members.&nbsp; The
two following have been selected as referring to subjects of
general interest.</p>

Members of the Mothers&rsquo; Society</i>, <i>during a few
weeks&rsquo; absence from home</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;4, <span
class="smcap">Nelson Crescent</span>, <span
class="smcap">Ramsgate</span>,<br />
<i>April</i> 16, 1854.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Friends</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gives me much pleasure to have this opportunity of
continuing my intercourse with you.&nbsp; I should have written
to you earlier, if I had not been so very much occupied in
various ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are few days in which I do not think of you, and
on this day especially (Wednesday, the usual day of our meeting)
I never forget to spend part of the evening in earnest prayer to
God, that He would bless you, and make you great blessings to all
with whom you are connected.&nbsp; I feel that your influence is
so great, either for good or evil, that, in blessing and teaching
you, God will be bestowing a rich blessing upon very many
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have so often spoken together, on the importance of
our influence over our children, that I do not just now intend
dwelling upon that.&nbsp; There is another view of this subject
which has often been present to my mind of late, and I should
like to try to interest you in it; I mean, the influence for good
which God designs our children should have over us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the time I resided in Bath, I met with a
circumstance which much impressed my mind with this view of the
subject; and I was glad, on looking <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>into my desk, the other day, to find
I had kept an account of it, as I am thus able to give it to you
more correctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have told you, I used to manage a Female
Friendly Society in Bath, that is, a society where a number of
poor women pay in so much a week, to have out a certain sum when
they are ill.&nbsp; The rule was, that when they required this
money they sent me a certificate, signed by a doctor, stating
that they were ill; and as long as the illness continued, they
sent to me every week for the money, each time producing lie
certificate.&nbsp; We used to meet once a fortnight, to pay in
money, settle accounts, &amp;c.&nbsp; At one of these meetings, I
said to a young woman&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I see, Esther, you have had money from this
society four weeks.&rsquo;&nbsp; She said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not four, ma&rsquo;am,&mdash;only
three.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked carefully over my accounts, and found that
money had really been paid to her name for four weeks.&nbsp;
After much inquiry and investigation, we found that
Esther&rsquo;s mother, a wicked and abandoned woman, had, by some
means, obtained the certificate, presented it; and had
appropriated the money to her own purposes.&nbsp; As soon as this
was quite ascertained, I declared my intention of calling upon
the woman, and talking to her about it.&nbsp; All of them who
knew her tried to dissuade me from this, assuring me that she was
such a dreadful character that I should hardly be safe from
personal violence.&nbsp; However, as such a thing could not be
allowed to pass unnoticed, I felt it <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>was right to go; and after earnest
prayer to God for a wise and understanding heart, I set out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was with much difficulty I found her out: she lived
in one of those deplorable places to be met with in all great
cities, where the workers of iniquity seek to hide
themselves.&nbsp; At last, I was directed to a little room at the
back of a very dirty old iron-shop.&nbsp; On entering, I saw a
very large woman standing in the room, her arms resting on her
hips, her red face and bloodshot eyes telling their own sad
tale.&nbsp; She did not speak, but stared at me with the bold
look of defiance.&nbsp; I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think your name is Alice
R&mdash;?&rsquo;&nbsp; She replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I should like to know what the likes of you have
to do with the likes of me?&rsquo;&nbsp; I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have a daughter, I believe, named
Esther?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wonder what business that is of yours?&rsquo;
she rejoined, with a terrible oath, and clenching her fist.&nbsp;
I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just now, that <i>is</i> business of
mine.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then taking a seat, dirty as it was, by way of
assuring her I was not going to be frightened from her presence,
I looked steadily at her, and said quietly&mdash;&lsquo;Alice, if
you had trusted me with your money to keep for you for a certain
purpose, and, when you applied to me for it, you found it had
been used by others, in ways never intended, what would you say
to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, say you ought to look sharper after it, to
be sure,&rsquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I then explained what was the object of my coming <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>to
her.&nbsp; She did not attempt to deny what she had done; but
said it was very well for the likes of me, who never knew the
want of anything, to come and preach to poor folks about
honesty.&nbsp; But still, though she kept up this kind of
bravado, I saw that, as we talked on, she softened a
little.&nbsp; I looked round the dark, dirty room, and
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Alice, this room is very dark, and perhaps you
think what passes in it is little noticed; but, indeed, there is
a day coming, when everything that has been done or said, or even
thought here, will be brought to light, and you will have to give
an account to God for it all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She clasped her hands together, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then that will be a dreadful day to me.&nbsp; I
was born and brought up in the midst of curses and blows; and I
have grown up to give curses and blows.&nbsp; You think it is
quiet enough here now; but come here an hour or two later, and
you would see what you never saw before.&nbsp; Why, bless you, I
don&rsquo;t think no more of knocking a man down, than I should
of knocking that ere candlestick off the table;&rsquo; and as she
suited &lsquo;the action to the word,&rsquo; and raised her
powerful arm, I could well believe this to be true.&nbsp; I
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But surely you did not bring up your child in
such a place as this?&rsquo;&nbsp; For I remembered that Esther
was gentle and modest&mdash;the very reverse of her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, indeed, I did not,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;When she was too little to leave me, I kept her out of the
way as much as I could; and when she got older, I spent <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>every penny
I could get to pay <i>them</i> for taking care of her, as knew
the way to do it; and now I never let her come here, though I
often go to see after her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But why,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;did you not, for
her sake, try to alter your home?&nbsp; Why did you not, then,
give up your wicked companions, and bring her up yourself in a
way you knew to be right?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;you are a lady,
and don&rsquo;t know nothing about such people as me.&nbsp; I
have heard <i>God</i> is powerful, but I know <i>Satan</i> is;
and we wicked people can&rsquo;t get away from one another, as
you think we can.&rsquo;&nbsp; I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just now, when you were telling me about your
early life, I was thinking you scarcely seemed to have had a
chance of being better than you are; but I see now that God has
not forgotten you.&nbsp; That little child was sent to awaken the
voice of conscience and love in you; and if you had only listened
to it, you might have saved yourself, as well as your
child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As we talked in this way; she wept very much;
but said, that it was all now too late,&mdash;that God was her
enemy, and there was no mercy for her.&nbsp; I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Alice, you keep this window so duty, that the
light can scarcely enter; and you never seem to open it, so that
the air of this room is almost stifling.&nbsp; But for all that,
there <i>is</i> bright sunshine and pure air, if you would let
them come in: and God intended them for you as much as for
me.&nbsp; And in the same way you surround yourself with what is
wicked, and must of <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>necessity produce misery, and then
complain that God has no mercy upon you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked her if she had ever heard of Jesus, who was so
sorry for the misery of such unhappy persons as herself, that He
came into the world on purpose to save them..&nbsp; She said she
had; but she knew He did not mean her.&nbsp; When I rose to go
she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It seems to me, that yours must be the first
kind voice I have ever heard; but I shall never hear it
again&mdash;no never; for you must not come here&mdash;indeed you
must not: this is no place for the likes of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then, why,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;do you not
determine to get such a home for yourself as I could come
to?&rsquo;&nbsp; But she shook her head and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! you don&rsquo;t know nothing;&rsquo; and so
we parted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say the thought will strike you, as it did me,
when I was afterwards thinking over what had passed between us,
what a wonderful influence for good this little child was
intended to have over the poor mother!&nbsp; It seemed to awaken
in her a better nature than she had ever known before; it was, as
the Bible expresses it, her &lsquo;day of visitation;&rsquo; and
if she had only permitted herself to come entirely under its
influence, she might have been saved for both time and
eternity.&nbsp; In her earnest endeavours to instruct her child
in what was true and right, she would have found it out for
herself, and, instead of being the poor fallen creature I found
her, she might have become a useful and valuable member of
society.</p>
<p><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>&ldquo;God has wisely and kindly implanted in our minds
such a feeling towards our children, that we value and strive to
obtain what is good, more for their sakes than for our own: and
we should feel thankful for this; for <i>whatever</i> makes us
hate sin, and love holiness, is a great blessing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we, my dear friends, truly and faithfully do our
duty to our children, we shall have no time for bad company, bad
books, idle gossip, or any other of those many temptations which
&lsquo;Satan finds for idle hands to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us be thankful, then, for an honourable and useful
occupation; and let it cheer us in the midst of employment,
sometimes wearisome and painful, to think that, by exercising a
right and holy influence over our children, we may be preparing
them for usefulness on earth, and an eternity of happiness
hereafter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that some of you have to experience great
suffering; that the toil of your lives is excessive.&nbsp; I know
of nothing that can tend so much to reconcile you to all this, as
to remember that, whatever your lot may be, it is of God&rsquo;s
appointment; that He has wise ends to answer by it; and in
another world, if not in this, you will know that the course you
have had to take was the best for you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is much that is dark and mysterious in the
present state of things: it is useless to attempt to explain it
away, neither do I think we are called upon to do so.&nbsp; The
only state of mind, suitable to our present condition, is entire
submission to the will and appointment <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>of our
heavenly Father.&nbsp; We must <i>trust</i> now; we shall
<i>know</i> hereafter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we are tempted, by the trials of our lot, to think
hard thoughts of Him who has appointed it, let us
remember&mdash;&lsquo;He that spared not his own Son, but
delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also
freely give us all things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have written this amidst many interruptions; but I
know you will believe me when I say, I have earnestly desired to
say something to comfort and strengthen you for your daily
trials.&nbsp; May God bless you, my dear friends; may we have
many more pleasant meetings here; and when the battle of life is
over, may we all meet in that world where sin and sorrow can
never enter.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Copy of a Letter written during
an absence of some months</i>, <i>in consequence of
illness</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Bath</span>, <i>November</i> 6, 1855.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Friends</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am truly sorry to be obliged to be absent from you so
long.&nbsp; It has always given me much pleasure to meet you at
our weekly meetings, and I now miss them very much.&nbsp; I shall
be indeed thankful when it pleases God to restore me to health,
and enable me to resume my usual place among you.</p>
<p><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>&ldquo;I have thought much and often, during my long
illness, how entirely we are dependent upon God for every power
we possess, both of mind and body.&nbsp; We can work only by His
permission.&nbsp; In a moment, if He sees fit, He can withdraw
from us all our powers; and we are perfectly helpless until it
pleases Him to restore them to us.&nbsp; To those who really love
God, and are His children, it is a delightful thought that He
controls everything.&nbsp; It is the happiest thing in the world
to know, that a wisdom which cannot err, and a love which cannot
fail, are conducting us through the journey of life, instead of
our own erring judgment.&nbsp; I wish we could all <i>feel</i>
this, as well as know it.&nbsp; It is God&rsquo;s great gift that
He is willing to bestow upon us all, if we constantly and
earnestly seek it from Him.&nbsp; The highest earthly station,
and all that wealth can purchase, will bring no happiness
compared with having our wills made one with God&rsquo;s
will.&nbsp; If you obtain this, my dear friends, poor as some of
you are, you might be objects of envy to many of the great ones
of the earth, who are wearied in the greatness of their way, not
having yet learned the great lesson of submission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is much, just now, which makes us fear we are
entering upon a winter of peculiar trial and difficulty.&nbsp;
The high prices of provisions must occasion many of you great
anxiety; and much care and economy will, I am sure, be required
to make you at all comfortable.&nbsp; Though <i>all</i>
departures from God&rsquo;s law must be followed by suffering, it
seems <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>that <i>war</i>&mdash;which cannot be engaged in
without breaking most of the commandments of God, and setting
aside entirely the precepts of love and forgiveness of
injuries&mdash;must be attended with great suffering to any
nation that engages in it.&nbsp; God, who made the world, knows
exactly by what laws it ought to be governed; and we cannot set
aside those laws, without bringing great sorrow upon
ourselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall all, I fear, have much to suffer from the
present war; and I truly grieve that such a considerable share of
this suffering must be borne by the poor.&nbsp; We must learn
from it this great lesson, that it is an evil and a bitter thing
to depart from God; and let it be an inducement to instil more
carefully than ever into the minds of our children principles of
love and kindness, teaching them, especially, to forgive
injuries, as Jesus did, instead of revenging them, which He told
us not to do.&nbsp; Thus, when they grow up to have their
influence as men and women, and to form a part of the great
nation, they may in every way promote &lsquo;<i>peace on
earth</i>, and good-will towards men.&rsquo;&nbsp; I trust that
He who hears the young ravens when they cry, and feedeth them,
will, at this trying season, provide food for you and your
children.&nbsp; For nothing is too hard for the Lord; and those
among you, who really love and trust God, may derive the greatest
consolation from the beautiful promise&mdash;&lsquo;None of them
that trust in me shall be desolate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was reading, a little while ago, about a young <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>woman who
was early in life deprived by death of her nearest relations, and
whose lot was to live with people who were extremely unkind,
indeed even cruel, to her.&nbsp; She was a very amiable person,
and pleasing in appearance.&nbsp; A gentleman, in a higher
station of life than her own, was informed of her history; and,
after a short acquaintance, made her an offer of marriage.&nbsp;
The persons with whom she lived, instead of being glad at the
prospect of such an improvement in her circumstances, were only
the more exasperated against her; and, having the power, they
refused to give her up until she was of age; and endeavoured to
make her more unhappy than ever.&nbsp; A friend once remarked to
her, that he wondered how she could bear such treatment.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I hardly feel it; it is to
last so short a time!&nbsp; I only think of myself as the future
wife of that kind gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought directly, that this was just the spirit in
which we should pass through life.&nbsp; We should then be brave
of heart, and not disheartened at our difficulties.&nbsp; It is,
indeed, a wonderful thought that the poorest and meanest being
who toils upon the earth may be heir to a state of happiness and
glory too great for description; as it is said&mdash;&lsquo;Eye
hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart
of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But though it is plainly our duty to cultivate this
spirit of submission and trust in God under all circumstances,
yet it is most important that we should <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>endeavour
so to provide against calamity, that, if it comes, we may not
have the pain of thinking how much our sufferings have been
brought about by our own misconduct God has so ordered things in
this world, that our success or failure will always depend much
upon ourselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been truly remarked, that only in one relation
of life is choice left to us.&nbsp; You will see that I refer to
the relation of husband or wife.&nbsp; On this, however, more
than on any other, depends our happiness and the happiness of
those connected with us.&nbsp; You will, perhaps, say that in
writing to those who have already made their choice, and whose
position, in this respect, is unalterable, it cannot be of any
use to make such remarks.&nbsp; But I feel, and you will feel
with me, that, in our children, we live our own lives over again;
and the more we have suffered from any particular mistake, which
we may ourselves have made, the more anxious we should feel to
shield those dear to us from similar misfortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many people at the present time who are
thinking a great deal about the suffering of the poor, and are
trying to find out how it arises, and how it can in some way be
lessened.&nbsp; One very general opinion is, that much misery is
brought about by early and imprudent marriages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One great difference between people in my position of
life and in yours is, that, generally speaking, before incurring
the expenses attendant on married life, we wait to reap the
fruits of many years of careful industry.&nbsp; <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>We
frequently defer marriage until both parties are even between
thirty and forty years of age, instead of taking this important
step without making any provision for the future, and often
before either the one or the other has attained the age of
twenty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady once entreated a girl of eighteen to defer her
marriage until she, or her intended husband, had saved sufficient
money to provide a little comfortable furniture for their room,
as well as to have a few pounds in hand to fall back upon in case
of necessity.&nbsp; She pointed out to her what sufferings might
arise in many ways, if they did not follow her advice.&nbsp; The
girl replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think, if John and I don&rsquo;t mind it,
nobody else need trouble their heads about it.&nbsp; If trouble
comes, we shall just have to bear it; and it is nothing to
anybody else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happen to know the history of this family, and all
that followed.&nbsp; Work was plentiful at first, and John earned
pretty good wages; but Sarah&mdash;for that was her
name&mdash;had married before she had learned how to make the
most of money, as you will suppose, when I tell you that she had
to <i>pay</i> for the making of her wedding gown.&nbsp; The
husband soon found the public-house was more attractive than his
dirty home and miserably cooked meals; and you know, after that
happens, how fast the money goes.&nbsp; But the saddest part of
all relates to the poor, unoffending, helpless children, who came
one by one into this wretched dwelling.&nbsp; Their mother was
not badly disposed, and <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>had she spent ten years longer,
before marriage, in learning how to provide for the wants of the
body, and train the mind, she might have done better than many
women; but, as it was, on the whole face of the earth the eye
could scarcely alight on a more completely wretched spot than
this one room, where, day after day, the father, mother, and
children suffered everything that can enfeeble the body and
degrade the mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The united effect of cold, bad air, starvation, and
neglect, was to consign seven out of nine of their children to
the grave before they had reached their sixth year.&nbsp; The
other two are, I believe, still living, the inmates of a
workhouse; their deformed and diseased bodies preventing the
possibility of their earning their own livelihood.&nbsp; As they
pass their suffering days and wearisome nights in that dreary
abode, with <i>nothing</i> to hope so far as this world is
concerned, how bitterly could they protest against their
mother&rsquo;s remark that her imprudent marriage was nothing to
any one else but herself!&nbsp; The father and mother are long
since dead; disease, brought on prematurely by intemperance, cut
short their lives before they had lived out half the time usually
appointed to man on earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sure that most of such suffering might be saved,
if mothers would try from the first to present this subject in a
right light to their children.&nbsp; Much good may be done, too,
by endeavouring to raise the tastes of young people so that they
shall <i>like</i> to surround themselves with what is good, and
neat, and <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>comfortable; for this <i>feeling</i> belongs quite as
much to your position in life as to mine.&nbsp; The only
difference is as to the degree in which it can be carried
out.&nbsp; Believe me, it is anything but a <i>virtue</i> for a
young couple to begin life together, satisfied with just one room
to live in, furnished with a bed stuffed with straw, a table, and
a few broken chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I once had a servant who lived with me many
years.&nbsp; At last, she became engaged to a respectable young
carpenter in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Out of their joint savings
the furniture was provided, and a comfortable room downstairs and
one above.&nbsp; When she was telling me this, I said I supposed
they were now ready to be married.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,
ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;not yet.&nbsp; I want to
have some nice curtains to my window, and a plant-stand; and if I
stay here a few more months, I can get that without touching the
&pound;30 I have in the savings&rsquo; bank.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
admired and respected her much for her good taste and
resolution.&nbsp; I need hardly say, she is now an excellent wife
and mother, and many pieces of furniture have been added to their
little establishment since their wedding day&mdash;a bright
contrast to those many cases in which, when the first difficulty
arises, one thing after another is taken to the pawn-shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another way in which some of you may do good,
and that is, by trying to shelter and protect young girls more
than is generally done.&nbsp; The character of a poor girl is
quite as valuable as that of a girl in any other station of life,
and ought to be as carefully <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>watched over.&nbsp; By taking care
so to arrange the work that no errands are left till after it is
dark, or if, when going out in the evening cannot be avoided, you
accompany them yourself, or get a friend to do so, much mischief
and sorrow would be saved.&nbsp; I am sure, nothing would do more
to raise the people of this country, and bring about a better
state of things, than an improvement in the manners of young
women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we are ever to have such an improvement as I hope
for, it will be obtained chiefly by the influence of mothers on
these young people; and for their sakes, if not for our own, we
should strive to get a taste for &lsquo;all that is good, and
beautiful, and true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In bringing this long letter to a close, you must allow
me to thank you very much for all the kindness and sympathy you
have shewn me during my illness.&nbsp; I continually hear of your
kind inquiries, and they are indeed pleasant to me.&nbsp;
Thoughts of you have cheered many solitary hours, and I shall be
delighted to come amongst you again.&nbsp; I have felt my absence
from you one of the greatest privations which I have had to
bear.&nbsp; I have now the bright hope before me of being able to
take my place among you in about a fortnight from this time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Till then, <i>then</i>,
believe me,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Your sincere
friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span><span
class="smcap">Each</span> year&rsquo;s intimacy with the
interesting people of whom I have written has afforded fresh
information, so that I find myself embarrassed with a multitude
of facts; and after six years&rsquo; experience, selection from
the accumulation of details is the only difficulty.&nbsp; It
would be easy to multiply scenes of interest, equalling any
already described; but if enough have been given to awaken
sympathy, and stimulate to exertion, my object is
accomplished.&nbsp; A few observations on subjects of great
importance, not prominently brought forward in any of the
preceding narratives, will be sufficient to close the whole.</p>
<p>One of the greatest obstacles which meets those who are
striving to improve the homes of the poor is the construction of
dwellings.&nbsp; There are whole streets of houses in this
neighbourhood, whose appearance gives you the idea that they were
originally designed for a higher class of people; and yet the
builder must have known that the supply of such houses was
already much beyond the demand, and that, if let at all, the
inmates must be poor.&nbsp; Nothing, however, adapts them for
this class of inhabitants.&nbsp; Five or six families may
occasionally <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>be found in one such house, with no more provision for
health, comfort, and decency, than ought to be made for each
one.</p>
<p>The houses professedly erected for the poor are still more
deficient.&nbsp; They are sometimes built below the level of the
road, so that the drainage is <i>to</i> them, instead of
<i>from</i> them.&nbsp; The basements are consequently fearfully
damp, and the whole atmosphere, in every part of the house, is
impregnated with the effluvia from stagnant sewage.</p>
<p>The materials used in buildings are so bad, and the
workmanship so inferior, that the floors are always loose, and
everything seems constantly getting out of order.&nbsp; We have
whole streets of small six-roomed houses let out entirely to the
poor; so that three families frequently live in one house.&nbsp;
<i>There is no outlet to the air at the back of these
dwellings</i>, <i>either by door or by window</i>.&nbsp; One
long, blank wall is all that is to be seen.&nbsp; Frequent
illness prevails among the inhabitants of these streets, and I
can never forget the scenes presented there during the visitation
of the cholera.&nbsp; I cannot bear to dwell upon them, but, for
the sake of my subject, I must mention one case.&nbsp; In a small
bed-room on the top floor of one of these dwellings I found, one
morning, that a woman and a child had died in the night; and
another woman in the same room, though still living, appeared in
a dying state.&nbsp; I shudder when I think of that room; no pen
can describe its horrors.&nbsp; It was a close, hot morning in
July, not a breath of air was stirring.&nbsp; The window was
thrown up at the bottom; <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>it could not be opened at the top;
and as there was no draught through the house to draw the air
into the room, very little relief could be obtained.&nbsp; The
dying woman was the mother of little children, and I would have
given anything to save her.&nbsp; The only possible expedient
that suggested itself to me was to have some of the bricks forced
out of the back wall.&nbsp; This was done; but all was in vain,
the poor mother died, surviving her husband only a few days; and
the little children either cried in the street, or were cared for
by a neighbour, till they were taken away to the workhouse.</p>
<p>As I left that street, I could think only of the
words&mdash;&ldquo;It is of the Lord&rsquo;s mercies we are not
consumed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The contrivances of men seemed so fraught
with destruction, that, if it were not for the interposition of
God, the consequences would be still more disastrous.</p>
<p>I sat down as soon as I reached home, and wrote a letter to
the editor of the <i>Times</i>, describing the scenes I had
witnessed that morning, calling his attention particularly to the
construction of those houses; and then asked, in the bitterness
of my heart, if, with all our extensive and costly paraphernalia
of government, nothing could be done to stop this awful waste of
comfort, health, and life.&nbsp; The importance of the subject at
once commended itself.&nbsp; The narrative not only appeared, but
was backed by every argument and appeal that the talented pen of
the editor could bring to bear upon it.&nbsp; But there it ended:
no steps have <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>been taken to make the construction of such dwellings
contrary to the law of the land.&nbsp; Many fathers, mothers, and
children, too, have since died in those streets; only, in these
cases, by lingering fever, instead of by sudden cholera.&nbsp;
Surely the cries of distress must have ascended again and again,
and have &ldquo;entered into the ears of the Lord of
Sabaoth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there is still a darker side to this grievance.&nbsp; The
death of the few is less calculated to excite our compassion,
than the miserable, lingering existence of the many.&nbsp; When I
see the little boys and girls playing before the doors, often
with crooked backs or crooked limbs, with emaciated forms and
faces, if not with still more unmistakable marks of disease, I
cannot help thinking,&mdash;Are these boys to be our future
working-men, upon whose sinew and muscle we are to depend for
cultivating our soil, constructing our railways, sinking our
mines, and defending our country; and are these girls to be the
mothers of the next generation?</p>
<p>There was mercy, as well as judgment, in the punishment that
followed the disobedience of our first parents.&nbsp; The
sentence, &ldquo;In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat
bread,&rdquo; is not an unmitigated evil.&nbsp; The most active
persons are generally the most cheerful; and the hard workers are
usually happier than the deep thinkers.&nbsp; But when the body,
which God intended and adapted for labour, has, by the habitual
violation of the laws of health, during all its first years,
become enfeebled and deranged, the necessity for exertion <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>becomes a
<i>painful</i> reality, and may, indeed, be looked upon as a
curse&mdash;as &ldquo;the dark cloud without a silver
lining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a deeper meaning than some suppose in that constant
application for &ldquo;light places,&rdquo; of which we hear so
much.&nbsp; Some tell us, it is all indolence; and thus on the
surface it often appears.&nbsp; But surely there must be some
cause, even for indolence.&nbsp; A child of good constitution,
and where health has been judiciously cared for, becomes, as soon
as he is able to manifest his power, almost inconveniently
active.&nbsp; The nurse complains that &ldquo;he will never bide
still;&rdquo; that she &ldquo;can&rsquo;t get a minute&rsquo;s
peace for him;&rdquo; that &ldquo;there is no end to the mischief
he does.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, a child is not active from principle,
nor because he feels it would be wrong to be indolent.&nbsp; He
has not to be instructed to move, although he sometimes has to be
taught to be still.&nbsp; Activity is the joy of his life, and
would doubtless continue so, if it were not for the evil
influences that are permitted to surround the body, marring
God&rsquo;s beautiful work, and bringing down the dishonouring
reflection upon the Creator, that man, as he is constituted, is
&ldquo;not strong enough for his place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A friend of mine was changing her residence a short time
ago.&nbsp; She wished to retain throughout the day the men who
were employed in removing her furniture; she therefore provided a
dinner for them at her own house, to prevent the necessity of
their returning home.&nbsp; Some meat-pies were warmed for them,
which <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>had been made the previous day; and this, with the
addition of hot potatoes, made a nice dinner.&nbsp; As the men
left in the evening, they thanked her for their good dinner,
especially that she had taken the trouble to have it made
<i>hot</i> for them; &ldquo;for you see, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; they
added, &ldquo;there is such nasty air in the places where we
sleep, that we never care to eat when we get up in the morning;
nor yet much at any other time, except it is made tasty, like,
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If such is the case, whence is the strength for labour to
come?&nbsp; The workman&rsquo;s livelihood depends upon his
ability to work.&nbsp; He may not leave off to rest because he is
tired.&nbsp; This is a sad subject, and it reveals to us the
great source of intemperance.&nbsp; Is it any wonder that, if a
man has a few pence in his pocket, he cannot pass the doors of a
public-house without feeling a strong temptation to go in and
purchase what, though imparting no strength, enables him to
forget for a time the miseries of his existence?</p>
<p>There are two things which I cannot understand: 1st, That the
government should do so little for the people in the way of
sanitary reform; and, 2d, that the people should so seldom ask
them to do more.&nbsp; It is a matter of much regret that the
only subjects which our legislators take up, when they come among
their constituents, are such topics as &ldquo;Extension of the
Franchise,&rdquo; &ldquo;Vote by Ballot,&rdquo; &ldquo;Electoral
Districts,&rdquo; &ldquo;Foreign Policy;&rdquo; while Education,
Temperance, and Sanitary Science are completely excluded.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to go through the Parliamentary <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>reports of
a year, and note what proportion of time the representatives of
the people spend in doing or saying anything that has reference
to the moral and physical elevation or general well-being of
their constituents.&nbsp; I am quite willing to acknowledge that
my want of appreciation of what is actually done may arise from
an inability to comprehend the magnitude and importance of these
subjects to the country.&nbsp; But, granting this, may it not at
the same time justly be said, &ldquo;These ought ye to have done,
and not to have left the other undone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must confess that, up to the present moment, I cannot
comprehend how <i>anything</i> can be more advantageous to the
country than the elevation of its own people.&nbsp; This need
not, at the present day, be undertaken hopelessly.&nbsp; Enough
has already been accomplished, through Ragged Schools alone, to
shew what can be done.&nbsp; Most of the evils from which our
poor people suffer are fortunately removable.&nbsp; They do not
arise from bad climate, unfruitful soil, determined hostility on
the part of the governed, or determined oppression on the part of
the governors.</p>
<p>The way in which the poor usually respond to efforts made for
their relief, the patience and forbearance they manifest in times
of public calamity, are most encouraging to witness, and prove
that &ldquo;English hearts and English hands&rdquo; are worthy of
the assistance which an active and sensible government could
extend to them.&nbsp; I cannot think of anything, at the present
time, that would be so helpful to the poor as suitable,
well-adapted <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>houses to live in.&nbsp; The miserable places which
they are now compelled to call homes have a great deal to do with
<i>all</i> the immorality that is to be found among them.&nbsp;
No one, who has taken the trouble to investigate the matter, can
doubt this for a moment; and as long as there are people in the
world unconscientious enough to erect such dwellings for the poor
as those we have described, it must surely be a right and proper
thing for the legislature to step in and say, &ldquo;We will not
stand by and see our people mentally, morally, and physically
degraded in this way: we interpose our authority, and insist that
such-and-such modes of construction can no longer be
permitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we must also consider the other side of the
subject&mdash;the indifference of the working-classes themselves
in obtaining assistance from their rulers.&nbsp; The fact is,
they so seldom hear that any but purely political matters claim
attention, that they can hardly realise the possibility of being
helped by government out of any domestic difficulties.&nbsp;
Nothing, however, can justify their foolish clamour for what, if
obtained, could in no way benefit them.&nbsp; I have often told
working-men that, so long as they continue to ask for stones when
they want bread, they must expect only to get stones.</p>
<p>I once witnessed a very exciting election, from the windows of
a house at Bath.&nbsp; I shall never forget the sight of that sea
of human faces, which extended as far as the eye could reach, and
all directed towards the hustings.&nbsp; It was a cloudless day
in July.&nbsp; The sun beat piteously down upon the many
uncovered heads, <a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>yet there they stood&mdash;this closely-packed mass of
people&mdash;from ten or eleven in the morning till two or three
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, enduring an amount of torture
that was worthy of a better cause.&nbsp; A gentleman, who was
witnessing it from the same window, was greatly distressed at the
sight; and, at last, when some one was carried out of the crowd
in an unconscious state, he stamped his foot, and, as if he could
bear it no longer, exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no patience with it&mdash;such a set of muffs
broiling themselves to death under the sun, and shouting
themselves hoarse, for they don&rsquo;t know what.&nbsp; If there
were any chance of their getting any good out of it, I might
respect them for their powers of endurance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;if, for instance, they were
agitating that a bill might be brought into Parliament for making
it the law of the land that all windows should be made to open at
the top as well as at the bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; replied my friend; &ldquo;or that wages
were always to be paid before four o&rsquo;clock on Saturday
afternoon.&nbsp; Yes, I could respect them for <i>that</i>,
instead of despising them, as, upon my word, I now do, for their
much ado about nothing; that is, about nothing to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am, however, induced to think, from much which I have met in
my own experience, and also from what I have heard through other
observers, that among the better class of working-men (a class
whose value and importance to this country cannot be
over-estimated) there is a sincere wish to avail themselves of
the assistance <a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>of any helping hand held out to their relief.&nbsp;
They have often confided to me their troubles, with the
simplicity and earnestness of children, and have asked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think, ma&rsquo;am, you could do anything for
us?&nbsp; We should be so glad, if you could put us up to some
better way of getting on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This subject is worth every attention, even with those who
take no higher ground than what will <i>pay</i>.&nbsp; How many
of the victims of unhealthy houses are now crowding into our
hospitals, asylums, and workhouses, a burden to their country,
living upon its wealth, instead of adding to it by their activity
and skill!&nbsp; Sin and sorrow, in this world, are
inseparable.&nbsp; Neglect and bad management have made the very
class intended by a wise and kind Creator as the spring of the
country&rsquo;s greatest wealth, to become a source of great
trouble and expense.</p>
<p>If there is any doubt as to the <i>duty</i> of caring more for
the poor, we have only to look at the example of Him who went
about doing good, who, &ldquo;when He saw the multitudes, had
compassion upon them.&rdquo;&nbsp; We cannot, like Him, heal the
sick and cleanse the leper; but, by the use of appointed means,
how much sickness and moral leprosy may be prevented!</p>
<p>If the government of this country would, in this way, follow
the steps of &ldquo;another King, even Jesus,&rdquo; doing
justly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with God, then might we
look for the fulfilment of the promise&mdash;&ldquo;I will open
the windows of heaven, and pour out upon you such a blessing as
there shall be <a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>scarce room to contain.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now that dark
clouds are rising around our political horizon, and many hearts
are failing them for fear, is it not a time to turn unto God in
the way that He has Himself marked out?&mdash;&ldquo;Is not this
the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bands of wickedness, to
undo the heavy burdens, to let the oppressed go free, and that ye
break every yoke?&nbsp; Is it not to deal thy bread to the
hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy
house: when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that
thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?&nbsp; Then shall thy
light break forth as the morning, and thy health shall spring
forth speedily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we contemplate how great a change would be wrought in a
nation, were its rulers men fearing God, and hating covetousness,
and, like Daniel, going many times a-day to ask counsel of the
Lord, we seem to see the pen moving in the hand of the recording
angel, as he writes, &ldquo;No weapon formed against it shall
prosper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must return for a moment to our own more immediate
work.&nbsp; In consequence of the disadvantage to which we have
alluded, we have not been able to effect all the improvement we
could wish in the dwellings of our poor mothers; but, by the
introduction of cleanliness, order, and ventilation, the aspect
of many homes has been much changed.&nbsp; Soon after we
commenced these meetings, we spent the greater part of one
evening in explaining the nature and effects of pure air and
ventilation, and illustrating the subject in <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>various
ways.&nbsp; The listeners were startled at the facts brought
before them: and by their unfeigned expressions of astonishment,
it was evident that their ideas on the subject, and
nature&rsquo;s intentions, were quite at variance.&nbsp; Several
months afterwards, on entering a house where two of our poor
mothers lived, I was pleased to observe how clean and
well-ventilated it was.&nbsp; On remarking this, one of the women
said&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! that was a wonderful evening when you told
us all about what air we could live upon, and what we
couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I says to Mrs L&mdash;, as we were going
home, &lsquo;There now, we have been a-shutting up our windows,
and thinking we were shutting the <i>pizen</i> out, instead of
which we were shutting of it in.&rsquo;&nbsp; I soon got my
window made to open at the top, and it has never been quite shut
since; for we always sleeps six in this room.&nbsp; The
neighbours did say, at first, that we should catch our deaths;
but they soon saw that we were so much better, that half the
people in the street open their windows at the top
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This same woman came to me a few weeks ago, and told me that
she had lately removed into another street, where the houses were
apparently of a better order than those she had left; but after
the first week or two, she found that, in consequence of a
drain-pipe being out of order, they were constantly subjected to
an unpleasant smell.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell my landlord of
it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;every Monday morning when I pay my
rent; and he always says to me, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll send a man here
in a day or two, and have it put to rights;&rsquo; and that have
<a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>been
going on now for six weeks, and nobody has been a-near the place
to do anything yet.&nbsp; I have two children ill with fever; and
we all wake of a morning now with that old miserable, sick, tired
feeling we used to have before you told us how to manage
better.&nbsp; My boys said this morning, &lsquo;Mother, the work
do seem so hard now, to what it used to.&rsquo;&nbsp; You know,
ma&rsquo;am, the work isn&rsquo;t no difference; but we are all
getting pizen&rsquo;d with that nasty smell; and it do seem so
hard to me, for I have never had no illness to speak of among
&rsquo;em all, for the last four years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a very early period in our meeting we introduced a
whitewash brush.&nbsp; This is lent to any of the mothers who
apply for it.&nbsp; It is very frequently out; indeed, in the
spring of the year, it is seldom at home.&nbsp; As many as seven
or eight of these brushes have been worn out in the service of
the society since its commencement.&nbsp; A thick iron saucepan
is also kept at the house of one of our missionaries, and lent
for the purpose of soup-making.&nbsp; Each member is supplied
with a large printed receipt, giving particular direction for the
composition of this soup.&nbsp; This receipt is so valuable, that
I intend placing it at the end of this book.</p>
<p>There is one other subject to which I wish to refer, before
laying aside my pen.&nbsp; An objection has sometimes been raised
to the establishment of Mothers&rsquo; Societies, on the ground
that it is wrong to offer these poor women any inducement to
leave their homes; <a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>that accident may arise from their absence; that the
husband may be dissatisfied, and so forth.&nbsp; A lady once
reminded a working-man of these objections; he roughly replied,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of a woman being always at home, if
she can&rsquo;t do nothing&mdash;no good, when she is
there?&nbsp; Now she does pick up something at the meeting, and
we are all a sight better off the rest of the week for her going
there a bit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another lady, visiting at one of their
houses, asked the husband how he liked having to remain at home,
and take care of the children, while his wife was at the
meeting.&nbsp; His reply was, &ldquo;I should think, ma&rsquo;am,
that was little enough for me to do for all the good my wife gets
there.&nbsp; She is always bringing home bits of clothes for some
of us that she makes there, besides lots of things to talk
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be evident to all, that it is not possible for any
mother to spend every hour of her life at home.&nbsp; When,
unfortunately, she is obliged to assist in the maintenance of the
family, many hours of absence have to be provided for; and it is
not more difficult to arrange for her absence at the
Mothers&rsquo; Meeting than anywhere else.&nbsp; Children, from
the age of one to seven, are generally in bed before seven
o&rsquo;clock; older children are not so likely to get into
mischief; and the baby, if necessary, can be brought with the
mother.</p>
<p>It is not desirable, however, that any president should
require regularity of attendance.&nbsp; The illness of their
husbands or children, and many other things that may arise,
ought, of course, to keep the mothers <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>at home.&nbsp; When they have come
to me to apologise for their absence, as they frequently do, I
have generally to say, &ldquo;I should indeed have been sorry to
have seen you here under such circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is surely some want of sympathy in the hearts of those
who continue to urge this objection.&nbsp; A lady once not only
declined subscribing to the society on this plea; but said also,
it was all owing to the &ldquo;miserable mothers that the
servants of the present day were so bad; and she would not have
anything to do with such a set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who can dismiss their children, at pleasure, to the
nursery or the school-room, are apt to forget the sufferings of
others differently situated, whose lives are worn down by one
constant and unmitigated pressure.&nbsp; I have thought that one
principal reason why the poor mother often fails so much in her
duties is, that there are no <i>pauses</i> in her work.&nbsp; The
physical suffering and the weariness of spirit induced by this
constant toil have much to do with that fretfulness of temper
which often makes the homes of poor children wretched
indeed.&nbsp; A cord strained too tightly, and too long, will
snap at a touch that would otherwise have produced the sweetest
music.&nbsp; The words of sympathy which meet the ear at these
meetings refresh the wounded spirit.&nbsp; The thought is
suggested, that, painful and irksome as the work may often be, it
is of God&rsquo;s appointment; and that to do it for Him, and
with a view to His glory, at once ennobles and sanctifies it.</p>
<p><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>A
poor woman, whose heart had been renewed by Divine grace, once
said to me, &ldquo;I used to think I was the poorest, miserablest
thing in the world, always slaving about after children; but now
God has shewed me my work so different, that I wouldn&rsquo;t
change with the parson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following letter, which I received from one of our poor
mothers, will prove the truth of these observations better than
anything I can add:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Potteries</span>, <i>January</i> 7, 1856.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Christian
Friend</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very much my wish to have spoken a few words on
Thursday evening, but was unable to do so; therefore, to pacify
my conscience, I write to you, stating a few of the advantages I
have received since I became a member of your society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1st.&nbsp; That of sympathy.&nbsp; If I have been in
trouble and difficulty, you have ever lent a willing ear to my
tale of sorrow, and led me to cast my care on Him who has
promised to care for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2d.&nbsp; That of training my children in the best
way.&nbsp; Being obliged to work very hard for them, I have found
little time to spare for teaching them; but being reminded by you
so often that a mother&rsquo;s voice, a mother&rsquo;s look, a
mother&rsquo;s actions, are all noticed by children, I must say
it has often influenced me to bear with patience much that I
should not <a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>have done, and offer a silent prayer for their welfare;
and been more happy myself in thus acting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3d.&nbsp; We enjoy rest.&nbsp; Often with hurried step
we hasten there, and the first sound that salutes our ear is the
calm voice of prayer, which seems at once to hush the mind to
peace, and carry our sorrows to a throne of grace, where we find
relief and comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, there are the texts of Scripture, which often
prove a word in season.&nbsp; Sometimes we have been very tired,
by reason of the way; difficulties have beset our path, and every
hour of the day has been full of care; and perhaps we hear those
kind words&mdash;&lsquo;Come unto me, all ye that labour and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Cast
thy burden on the Lord, and he will sustain thee.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; We thus leave the place of meeting relieved
from much that would distress us.&nbsp; I have thus written a few
of the advantages derived from attending the Mothers&rsquo;
Meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Praying that a blessing may rest on you; and hoping you
will never grow weary in this work of faith and labour of
love,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Believe me to remain,<br />
Yours most respectfully,<br />
&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In drawing this narrative of facts to a close, I would make
one or two concluding remarks:&mdash;</p>
<p>Dr. Chalmers used to say that most of us think too much of our
abilities, and too little of our influence.&nbsp; <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>The force
of example is always great, even though the exemplar be a
fool.&nbsp; A man of the narrowest intellect will accomplish more
by personal conduct than the large-brained man will effect by
mere verbal precept.&nbsp; It is true not only that</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;A peasant may
believe as much as a great clerk,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but that he may <i>do</i> as much.&nbsp; Not only to hope and
to faith are the &ldquo;not many wise&rdquo; called, but to
charity also.&nbsp; We have seen in the preceding pages that our
Great Master has made use of the humblest servants to achieve
that which the professional philanthropist, with all his busy
schemes, had not been able to compass.&nbsp; Therefore to the
wise, who may chance to look into this volume, I would say,
&ldquo;Be not over-confident of success in undertaking the work
of which I have spoken.&nbsp; To charity, the heart is a far more
necessary and vital organ than the brain.&nbsp; What you do will
have twenty-fold the force of what you say.&nbsp; And in order to
do rightly, you must be content to learn of those whom you could
teach everything but this one thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those who are
conscious of much intellectual weakness I would encourage by the
narratives of what has been wrought by instruments of an even
less keen temper than they.</p>
<p>But I would not be understood to slight the literature of
philanthropy.&nbsp; Facts and figures, statistics compiled with
much toil and difficulty, are the foundation stones of all
legislative social reforms.&nbsp; They are indispensable in all
cases where we wish the government of a country to interpose.</p>
<p><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>Next,
I would observe that we should &ldquo;patiently wait&rdquo; for
results.&nbsp; There is a grand Eastern proverb which says,
&ldquo;Hurry is of the devil, but slow advancing comes from
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hurry is not progress; sure progress is
generally slow.&nbsp; It may not be given to us, who sow the
seed, to gather in the harvest.&nbsp; But if our faith is strong,
we shall believe that hereafter it will be our great reward to
join the glad song of the heavenly reapers, as they lay the
bounteous sheaves at the feet of the Lord of the harvest.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is one thing that is in the power of all of
us.&nbsp; However difficult it is to <i>do</i> our Father&rsquo;s
will on earth as it is done in heaven, we can at least
<i>pray</i> that His kingdom will speedily come; each may pray
for those who are in &ldquo;trouble, sorrow, need, sickness, or
any other adversity.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;More
things are wrought by prayer<br />
Than this world dreams of. . . .<br />
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br />
For so the whole round earth is every way<br />
Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

261</span>RULES FOR THE REGULATION OF THE MOTHERS&rsquo;
SOCIETY.</h3>
<p>1.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">That</span> this meeting shall
assemble one evening in the week, at seven o&rsquo;clock or
half-past seven, according to the season of the year, and close
as nearly as possible at nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That at every meeting a passage of Scripture shall be
read, and followed by prayer.&nbsp; The work shall then be
commenced, and deposits received, both for clothing and
savings&rsquo; bank.&nbsp; The lady who presides shall then read,
or relate something suitable to the object of the meeting, and if
desirable and time permit, conversation shall ensue.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Although remarks to the purpose will be highly valued
from any member of this Society, it will be necessary, to save
confusion, that all such remarks should be addressed to the
President of the meeting, and that not more than one shall speak
at a time.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; That we all endeavour to cultivate a spirit of
kindness and sympathy with one another, in our common <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>difficulties; and when cases of peculiar sorrow and
distress arise, they should be mentioned at the commencement of
the meeting, in order to be made the subject of special and
earnest prayer.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; That at these meetings no mention shall be made of
our neighbours&rsquo; faults and failings, but that we all,
faithfully and earnestly, seek to obtain the greatest possible
amount of assistance to aid us in our very important and often
difficult duties.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; That the Secretary will make a point of being at home
an hour before the commencement of each meeting, to see any
member of this Society who would like to speak with her
privately.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; That the articles of clothing provided, and sold at a
reduced price, shall be obtained only by those who have regularly
enrolled themselves as members of this Society.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; That no article of clothing shall be taken away until
finished, and paid for, unless by permission of the lady who
presides.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; That each member provide herself with thimble,
needles, and cotton.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; That the work be continued until the time arrives
for the concluding prayer by the Clergyman or the City
Missionary.</p>

<h4>HOW TO MAKE IT.</h4>
<p>Take an iron saucepan (a tin one will not do); put into it,
over the fire, your meat cut small, with two ounces of dripping,
and a quarter of an ounce of brown sugar, shred in your onions,
and stir with a wooden or iron spoon till fried lightly brown;
have <a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>ready washed and sliced your turnips, celery, and
leeks, add them to the rest over the fire, and stir about for ten
minutes.&nbsp; Now add one quart of cold water, and the
half-pound of barley or rice, and mix all well together.&nbsp;
Then add five quarts of hot water, made ready in the kettle,
season with your salt, stir occasionally till boiling, and then
let simmer on the hob for three hours; at the end of which time
the rice or barley will be tender.</p>
<p>This soup will keep two or three days if poured into a flat
pan, but it is best made every other day.&nbsp; You must stir
till nearly cold, when you take it off the fire, which will
prevent its fermenting.&nbsp; A little bread or biscuit eaten
with it makes a supporting meal, much better than a cup of tea,
and would go far to prevent the craving for gin.</p>
<p>Great care should be taken that the saucepan be perfectly
clean, the dripping and meat sweet, and the vegetables fresh.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
